## 💡 **TIPS FOR SUCCESS**

- **Use Guided Wizard for complex stories** - Fantasy, sci-fi, and intricate plots benefit from detailed planning
- **Don't worry about perfection** - You can edit all reference materials after generation

### **Reference Review Best Practices**
- **Read everything** - Understanding what the AI will use helps you write better
- **Edit character voices** - Make sure dialogue patterns match your vision  
- **Approve incrementally** - You don't need to approve everything at once
- **Regenerate if needed** - Not happy with a reference? Generate new content

### **Writing Effectively**
- **Start with AI generation** - Get a foundation, then add your unique voice
- **Use the sidebar sparingly** - Keep it closed most of the time for focus
- **Edit in the flow** - Don't stop to perfect every sentence; keep momentum
- **Approve when ready** - Only approve chapters you're genuinely satisfied with

### **Maintaining Momentum**
- **Set word count goals** - Track progress with the built-in counter
- **Write daily** - Even 15 minutes in Clean Mode can produce significant progress  
- **Trust the AI** - Let it handle structure while you focus on creativity
- **Edit later** - Get the story down first, polish in revision passes

## 🆘 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Reference Generation Issues**
- **Missing references?** Use the "Generate References" button on any empty reference tab
- **Poor quality output?** Try adding more detail to your book bible and regenerating
- **Inconsistent tone?** Edit the Style Guide reference to be more specific about voice

### **Chapter Generation Problems**  
- **Generic content?** Your references may need more specific character voices and plot details
- **Continuity issues?** Make sure previous chapters are approved before generating new ones
- **Stuck on generation?** Try the "Rewrite" button or manually edit to get unstuck

### **Interface Issues**
- **Sidebar won't hide?** Click the menu icon (≡) or click outside the sidebar area
- **Editor not responding?** Refresh the page - your work auto-saves continuously
