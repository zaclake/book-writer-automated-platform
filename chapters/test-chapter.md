# Chapter 1: The Investigation Begins

Detective Sarah Martinez stared at the case file spread across her desk. Three victims, all found in similar circumstances, all connected by a thread she couldn't yet see. The morning sun cast long shadows through the precinct windows, highlighting the gruesome photographs that would haunt her dreams.

"Another one came in overnight," Detective Johnson said, dropping a fresh file on her desk with a heavy thud. "Same pattern, same signature."

Sarah looked up from her coffee, the steam rising between them like a barrier. "Where this time?"

"Downtown. Near the cathedral." Johnson's voice carried the weight of too many similar conversations, too many sleepless nights. "But this one's different somehow."

She opened the file, scanning the preliminary report with practiced eyes. The victim was younger than the others, the circumstances slightly altered. But the signature was unmistakable - the killer's calling card left deliberately for them to find.

"We need to talk to the witness again," Sarah decided, closing the file with determination. "Something's not adding up in her story."

Johnson nodded, understanding the unspoken urgency. Time was running out. The killer was escalating, becoming bolder with each attack. They had to catch him before he struck again.

The investigation was just beginning, but Sarah felt the familiar tingle of pieces starting to connect. Truth had a way of surfacing, even when buried deep beneath layers of deception and fear.

She gathered the files, her mind already racing through the possibilities. Somewhere in these pages lay the answer. She just had to find it before it was too late.

The phone rang, interrupting her thoughts. Another case, another victim. The city never slept, and neither did its predators.

"Martinez," she answered, knowing her day had just gotten much longer.

The voice on the other end spoke in clipped, urgent tones. Another body. Another scene. Another chance to catch a killer.

Sarah grabbed her jacket and headed for the door. The hunt was on.
