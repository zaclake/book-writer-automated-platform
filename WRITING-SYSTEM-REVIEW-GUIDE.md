## 💡 **IMPROVEMENT IDENTIFICATION STRATEGY**

### **For Each File, Ask:**
1. **Purpose:** Does this file solve a real problem?
2. **Completeness:** Are there gaps in coverage?
3. **Integration:** How does this connect to other files?
4. **Usability:** Is this easy to understand and follow?
5. **Effectiveness:** Will this actually work in practice?

### **Common Improvement Areas:**
- **Missing automation** - Manual processes that could be automated
- **Unclear metrics** - Vague quality standards that need precision
- **Integration gaps** - Files that don't connect properly to the workflow
- **Usability issues** - Complex processes that need simplification
- **Missing edge cases** - Scenarios not covered by current systems

### **Documentation Quality:**
- **Clarity:** Are instructions clear and unambiguous?
- **Completeness:** Are all steps and requirements covered?
- **Examples:** Are there sufficient concrete examples?
- **Updates:** Do references match the new file organization?
