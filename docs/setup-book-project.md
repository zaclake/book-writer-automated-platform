# Book Project Setup Guide

This guide explains how to transform your `book-bible.md` into an organized, automated writing system.

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

1. âœ… You have filled out `book-bible.md` (copied from `docs/book-bible-survey-template.md`)
2. âœ… You're ready to start writing chapters

## ðŸ”„ Setup Process

### Step 1: Say "Initialize my book project"

When you're ready to begin, simply tell the AI: **"Initialize my book project"**

The AI will:
1. **Read your book-bible.md** - Parse all your story information
2. **Create the references folder** - Set up the organized file structure
3. **Generate reference files** - Transform your info into writing-ready documents
4. **Create the chapters folder** - Prepare for chapter writing
5. **Set up the notes folder** - Optional workspace for research/ideas

### Step 2: Review Generated Files

The AI will create these reference files based on your book bible:

#### `references/characters.md`
- **Protagonist profiles** with goals, flaws, arcs, voice
- **Antagonist details** with motivations and methods  
- **Supporting cast** with roles and relationships
- **Character consistency notes** for dialogue and behavior

#### `references/outline.md`
- **Chapter-by-chapter breakdown** with purposes and key events
- **Story structure** with act breaks and major plot points
- **Pacing notes** to maintain rhythm throughout
- **Scene-level details** where provided

#### `references/world-building.md`
- **Setting details** including time, place, and world rules
- **Location descriptions** with atmosphere and significance
- **Cultural elements** including customs and social structures
- **History and backstory** relevant to your plot

#### `references/style-guide.md`
- **Narrative voice** and POV preferences
- **Tone and mood** guidelines

#### `references/plot-timeline.md`
- **Story beats** organized chronologically
- **Subplot tracking** and how they interweave

### Step 3: Review and Refine

After generation, you can:
- **Review each reference file** to ensure accuracy
- **Request adjustments** if anything doesn't match your vision
- **Add details** to any sections that need more depth
- **Clarify ambiguities** before starting chapter writing

## ðŸŽ¯ What Happens During Setup

### Information Processing
The AI analyzes your book bible and:
- **Extracts explicit information** you've provided
- **Infers logical connections** between story elements
- **Fills creative gaps** while maintaining your vision
- **Organizes everything** for efficient chapter writing

### Intelligent Gap-Filling
Where you've left sections blank, the AI will:
- **Maintain consistency** with provided information
- **Follow genre conventions** appropriate to your story
- **Create logical connections** between characters and plot
- **Develop backstory** that supports your main narrative

### Quality Checks
The system will verify:
- **Character consistency** across all references
- **Plot logic** and timeline coherence
- **World-building consistency** and rule adherence
- **Style alignment** with your preferences

## ðŸ”§ Customization After Setup

### Adding Details
You can always:
- **Update your book-bible.md** with new information
- **Regenerate references** to incorporate changes
- **Manually edit reference files** for fine-tuning
- **Add research notes** to support chapter writing

### Iterative Development
The system supports:
- **Story evolution** as you discover new directions
- **Character development** beyond initial planning
- **Plot adjustments** based on writing discoveries
- **Style refinement** as your voice develops

## âœ… Ready to Write

Once setup is complete, you can start writing with simple commands:

- **"Write chapter 1"** - AI will use all references to craft your opening
- **"Write chapter 3"** - AI will maintain continuity with previous chapters
- **"Write the climax chapter"** - AI will build toward your planned resolution

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### If References Don't Match Your Vision:
1. **Clarify in book-bible.md** - Add more specific details
2. **Regenerate references** - AI will incorporate new information
3. **Manual edit references** - Fine-tune specific elements
4. **Provide feedback** - Tell AI what to adjust

### If Setup Seems Incomplete:
1. **Check your book-bible.md** - Ensure key sections are filled
2. **Ask for specific additions** - Request details for missing areas
3. **Review template** - See if you missed important sections
4. **Start writing anyway** - AI can develop details as you go
