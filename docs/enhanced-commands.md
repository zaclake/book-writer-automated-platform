## üéØ **PRIMARY COMMANDS**

### **"Write chapter X"**
**What you see:** Simple chapter request  
**What happens behind the scenes:**
1. **Context Loading**: All story references + pattern database + failure detection systems
2. **5-Stage Generation**: Strategic planning ‚Üí Draft ‚Üí Quality review ‚Üí Refinement ‚Üí Integration
3. **Automatic Auditing**: Voice consistency, plot logic, pattern freshness, quality validation
4. **Failure Detection**: Automated scanning for 10+ critical failure modes
5. **Human Escalation**: Flags critical issues requiring your input

**Time:** 15-20 minutes for bulletproof chapter  
**Output:** Chapter that scores 8+ in all quality categories or human intervention trigger

### **"Initialize my book project"**
**What happens:**
1. **Parse book bible** and extract all story information
2. **Generate reference files** with intelligent gap-filling
3. **Set up auditing baselines** for character voices, world rules, plot logic
4. **Create pattern database** for tracking repetition across chapters
5. **Initialize failure detection systems** for continuous monitoring

**Output:** Complete project structure ready for chapter writing

## üö® **AUDITING COMMANDS (AUTOMATIC)**

These happen automatically based on the auditing schedule. You'll only see them if intervention is needed.

### **Every 5 Chapters: Voice Drift Check**
**Automatic background process:**
- Compare recent character dialogue to established baselines
- Check for vocabulary/syntax drift toward generic AI language
- Verify personality markers remain intact

**You'll see:** "Character voice drift detected for [Character]. Review needed."

### **Every 10 Chapters: System Health Audit**
**Automatic background process:**
- Plot logic verification (cause-and-effect chains, character knowledge)
- Pacing analysis (tension variation, reader fatigue prediction)
- World consistency review (rule violations, geographic/cultural drift)

**You'll see:** "Plot logic issue detected in Chapter X" or "Pacing becoming monotonous, variation recommended"

### **Every 20 Chapters: Deep Structure Analysis**
**Automatic background process:**
- Emotional arc assessment across entire story so far
- Theme integration analysis (subtlety monitoring, symbolic overuse)
- Quality metric validation (gaming detection, human correlation)

**You'll see:** "Character emotional arc inconsistency detected" or "Themes becoming heavy-handed"
