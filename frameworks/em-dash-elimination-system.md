*Zero-tolerance punctuation compliance for Enhanced Writing System v2.0*

---

## üö´ **PROHIBITION OVERVIEW**

**EM-DASHES (‚Äî) ARE COMPLETELY FORBIDDEN** in all Enhanced Writing System content.

### **Why Em-Dashes Are Banned:**
- Create inconsistent reading rhythm
- Often indicate lazy sentence construction
- Can be replaced with more precise punctuation
- Violate the system's precision and clarity standards
- Professional publishing increasingly favors alternatives

---

## üîç **DETECTION METHODS**

### **Manual Search Protocol**
1. **Search Function**: Use Ctrl+F (or Cmd+F) to search for "‚Äî" in document
2. **Visual Scan**: Look for long horizontal lines between words
3. **Character Code**: Search for ASCII 8212 or Unicode U+2014
4. **Multiple Formats**: Check both rendered and source text

### **Common Em-Dash Appearances**
- **Standard Em-Dash**: ‚Äî (long dash)
- **Double Hyphen**: -- (sometimes auto-converts to em-dash)
- **Spaced Em-Dash**: ‚Äî with spaces around it
- **Connected Em-Dash**: word‚Äîword (no spaces)

### **Colons (:)**
- **Use for**: Introducing explanations, lists, or elaborations
- **Example**: "The cabinet contained everything: specimens, cards, and tools."

### **Commas (,)**
- **Use for**: Parenthetical information, setting off clauses
- **Example**: "The patient, a seventy-year-old woman, arrived early."

### **Semicolons (;)**
- **Use for**: Connecting related independent clauses
- **Example**: "The procedure was complete; the patient was satisfied."

### **Periods (.)**
- **Use for**: Strong breaks, separate thoughts
- **Example**: "The warning was delivered. The choice was made."

### **Parentheses ()**
- **Use for**: Truly parenthetical information

## üîß **SYSTEMATIC REPLACEMENT PROCESS**

### **Step 1: Identify Function**
Determine what the em-dash is doing in the sentence:
- Introducing explanation ‚Üí Use colon
- Parenthetical information ‚Üí Use commas
- Strong break ‚Üí Use period
- Connecting thoughts ‚Üí Use semicolon

### **Step 2: Test Readability**
Read the sentence aloud with the new punctuation:
- Does it flow naturally?
- Is the meaning clear?
- Does it maintain the intended rhythm?

### **Step 3: Verify Voice Consistency**
Ensure the replacement maintains character voice:
- Clinical precision for Mason
- Urgent energy for Lexie
- Appropriate formality level

## üö® **QUALITY CONTROL CHECKPOINTS**

### **During Writing**
- [ ] Mentally replace em-dash impulses with alternatives
- [ ] Use speech-to-text to catch natural pause patterns
- [ ] Review each paragraph for prohibited punctuation

### **After Each Chapter**
- [ ] **MANDATORY**: Search entire chapter for "‚Äî" symbols
- [ ] Verify zero results in search
- [ ] Double-check any long horizontal lines visually
- [ ] Confirm document character encoding hasn't converted hyphens

### **Before Final Submission**
- [ ] Complete manuscript search for "‚Äî" symbols
- [ ] Check all chapter files individually
- [ ] Verify no auto-formatting has introduced em-dashes
- [ ] Confirm style guide compliance

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE**

### **Auto-Formatting Issues**
**Problem**: Word processor converts "--" to em-dash
**Solution**: Disable auto-formatting for dashes or use alternative punctuation

### **Copy-Paste Contamination**
**Problem**: Copied text contains em-dashes
**Solution**: Paste as plain text, then manually replace

### **Character Encoding**
**Problem**: Document contains hidden em-dash characters
**Solution**: Use "Find and Replace" with character codes

### **Habit Breaking**
**Problem**: Naturally writing with em-dashes
**Solution**: Practice alternatives until they become automatic

---

## üìä **COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION**

### **Quick Check Protocol**
1. Open chapter file
2. Search for "‚Äî" (em-dash symbol)
3. Verify zero results
4. If found, apply replacement strategy
5. Re-search to confirm elimination

### **Automated Checking**
- Use text editor search function
- Create search shortcut for "‚Äî" symbol
- Set up find-and-replace macro if needed
- Run check before any chapter completion

## üìö **REFERENCE EXAMPLES**

### **Before System Implementation**
```
The human mouth contains thirty-two teeth‚Äîa statistical anomaly that occurs in less than eight percent of the population. My colleagues find this fascinating‚ÄîI find it appropriate.

The morning sun slanted through the venetian blinds‚Äîcasting precise shadows across the patient charts I'd been reviewing since six-thirty.
```

## üé≠ **WRITER TRAINING NOTES**

### **Mindset Shift**
- Think "precision over convenience"
- Each punctuation mark has specific purpose
- Alternatives often create better rhythm
- Professional writing requires discipline

### **Practice Exercises**
1. Rewrite 10 sentences containing em-dashes
2. Practice reading aloud with alternatives
3. Identify natural pause patterns in speech
4. Master colon usage for explanations

**REMEMBER**: Em-dash elimination is not about restriction; it's about precision. Every punctuation mark in the Enhanced Writing System serves a specific purpose with maximum clarity and impact.

**ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY**: Any em-dash usage triggers automatic quality gate failure and requires immediate correction before chapter completion.
