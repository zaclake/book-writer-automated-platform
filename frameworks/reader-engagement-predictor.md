## üìä **ENGAGEMENT PREDICTION MODEL**

### **Primary Indicators (Quick Assessment)**

#### **Hook Strength (Chapter Opening)**
- **Strong:** Immediate question, conflict, or intrigue in first paragraph
- **Medium:** Interesting setup but no immediate tension
- **Weak:** Pure exposition or description without hook

#### **Momentum Maintenance**
- **Strong:** Each scene/paragraph creates questions that pull reader forward
- **Medium:** Steady progress but occasional flat sections
- **Weak:** Sections where nothing compelling happens for pages

#### **Chapter Ending Propulsion**
- **Strong:** Ending creates urgent need to continue reading
- **Medium:** Satisfying conclusion but no forward pull
- **Weak:** Chapter feels complete, no reason to continue

#### **Conflict Density**
- **Strong:** Multiple levels of tension operating simultaneously
- **Medium:** Clear central conflict with occasional complications
- **Weak:** Conflict absent or too subtle to create engagement

### **Secondary Indicators (Pattern Analysis)**

#### **Dialogue vs. Exposition Ratio**
- **Engaging:** 60-70% dialogue/action, 30-40% exposition
- **Moderate:** 50-50 balance
- **Risky:** Over 60% exposition/description

#### **Question Generation Rate**
- **Strong:** New questions created every 2-3 pages
- **Medium:** Questions created every chapter
- **Weak:** No compelling questions raised

#### **Surprise Factor**
- **Strong:** Unexpected but logical developments every chapter
- **Medium:** Occasional surprises
- **Weak:** Completely predictable progression
