# Supporting Character Growth Framework
*From Secondary Figures to Story Drivers*

This framework ensures every recurring supporting character evolves meaningfully over the course of the story, adding depth, tension, and emotional resonance that push the narrative toward literary excellence.

---

## üéØ **OBJECTIVE**
Move supporting characters beyond plot helpers to fully realized individuals with independent arcs that intersect and enrich the protagonist's journey.

---

## üß© **CORE PRINCIPLES**
1. **Agency First**: Every supporting character wants something independent of the protagonist.
2. **Dynamic Change**: They must change internally, relationally, or functionally between first and last appearances.
3. **Plot Interweave**: Their growth must affect ‚Äì and be affected by ‚Äì the main plot.
4. **Cost & Consequence**: Growth requires sacrifice, mistakes, or setbacks.
5. **Distinct Voices**: They speak, think, and act in ways that reflect their unique background and arc stage.

## üõ†Ô∏è **ARC DESIGN TOOLKIT**

### **Growth Arc Components**
- **Baseline State**: Who are they when first introduced? (beliefs, relationships, competence)
- **Inciting Disruption**: Event that challenges their status quo
- **Progressive Obstacles**: Internal flaws or external pressures that impede change
- **Midpoint Shift**: Moment of insight, failure, or escalation that forces new tactics
- **Climax Decision**: Crucial choice that defines who they become
- **End State**: Who are they now? How have they changed?

### **Growth Types**
1. **Internal Transformation**: Belief/value change (e.g., cowardice ‚Üí courage)
2. **Relational Evolution**: Key relationship shifts (e.g., rival ‚Üí ally)
3. **Competence Mastery**: Skill growth (e.g., novice ‚Üí expert)

### **Risk Multipliers**
- **Cross-Purpose Goals**: Their growth complicates the protagonist's objective
- **Moral Dilemmas**: Choices that pit loyalty against self-interest
- **Sacrificial Costs**: They lose something meaningful to gain growth
