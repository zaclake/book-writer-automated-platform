# Character Profiles - The Spool Room

## Protagonist

### Debbie Harrow
- **Age:** Late 60s
- **Occupation:** Retired high school science teacher (biology, chemistry, physics); former mill worker in her youth
- **External Goal:** Understand the strange events unfolding around her; put the past to rest
- **Internal Goal:** Come to terms with her own buried history and responsibility to remember what others have forgotten
- **Fatal Flaw:** She is quietly avoidant—prefers silence over confrontation, especially with the past
- **Greatest Fear:** That she'll die without having truly acknowledged what her life—and her town—left undone
- **Voice:** Calm, smart, and observant—akin to Dolores Claiborne or Rachel from Tana French's The Secret Place. She's perceptive, but doesn't speak just to fill silence.

## Antagonist

### The Haunting (Millhaven Cotton Works)
- **Nature:** Not a single ghost, but the echo of the mill itself—its workers, its pain, its forgotten stories. A presence more than a person.
- **Motivation:** To be witnessed. To be remembered. It seeks neither revenge nor violence—just recognition.
- **Method:** Subtle manifestations: thread in strange places, waking dreams, cold spots, smells, electrical interference, sounds of machinery. It escalates only when ignored.
