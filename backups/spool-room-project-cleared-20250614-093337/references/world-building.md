# World-Building Reference - The Spool Room

## Setting Foundation

### Time & Place
- **Time Period:** Modern day (contemporary), approximately 2020s
- **Location:** Millhaven, South Carolina – a fictional Southern mill town inspired by Ware Shoals
- **World Type:** Real World
- **Technology Level:** Modern—smartphones, internet, satellite calls—but with patchy service in rural areas and minimal use by older characters. The haunting remains analog.

### Supernatural System
- **Magic/Special Systems:** No magic system. The supernatural manifests as a haunting rooted in memory, trauma, and unresolved history. No spells, rituals, or overt rules.
- **Haunting Nature:** Emotional, atmospheric—not violent or possession-based. Manifestations include thread in strange places, waking dreams, cold spots, smells, electrical interference, sounds of machinery.

## Social Structure

### Political Structure
- Small-town politics: mayor, council, school board
- Not a focus, but the decline in town services and pride is palpable

### Social Hierarchy
- Informal—defined by long-standing family roots, connections to the mill, and how long you've lived in town
- Mill families are respected, but there's a generational divide

### Cultural Elements
- Southern traditions, church potlucks, high school football pride
- Front porch culture and strong oral tradition
- The mill's legacy is ever-present in daily life

- **Picker house:** Where cotton was cleaned
- **Slashing room:** Where warp threads were sized
- **Brown lung:** Occupational lung disease from cotton dust
