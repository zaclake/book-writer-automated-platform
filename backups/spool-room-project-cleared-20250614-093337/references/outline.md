# Story Outline - The Spool Room

## Overall Arc
Debbie Harrow takes a tour of her town's abandoned textile mill before its demolition and sees a man in the spool room that no one else sees. As strange events unfold at home—thread appearing where it shouldn't, mechanical humming, waking dreams—she is drawn into a buried history of tragedy, forgotten labor, and lives never honored. The haunting intensifies until she returns to the mill and acknowledges the forgotten dead, offering memory as the only release they've ever been given.

## Core Theme
**Unacknowledged history haunts the present. Memory is the only true exorcism.**

## Story Beats

### Inciting Incident
Debbie sees the ghost of a man in the spool room during the mill tour.

### Plot Point 1
Threads begin appearing in her house; Ozzie becomes disturbed; she starts dreaming of the mill running.

### Midpoint
She uncovers a list of "quiet" disappearances connected to the final year of the mill's operation—and realizes her own mother's name is written on a machine part still in the building.

### Plot Point 2
A terrifying sequence in the Draper House and a vision at the river dam convince Debbie the haunting is escalating—and that it's waiting for her to remember and act.

### Climax
Debbie returns to the spool room at night. She lays the spool of thread and speaks aloud, acknowledging the ghosts. The room quiets. The lights flicker. She is no longer alone—but no longer afraid.

### Resolution
The mill is demolished. The strange occurrences stop. One last whistle blows, off-schedule. Debbie finally rests—because the dead finally can too.
