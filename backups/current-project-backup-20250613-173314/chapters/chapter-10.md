# Chapter 10: The Vienna Connection

*Midnight, Rome - Castel Sant'Angelo*

---

Claire had always assumed that clandestine midnight meetings would involve more shadows and dramatic lighting, but it turned out that the most unsettling thing about meeting mysterious contacts in ancient Roman fortresses was how normal everything looked when illuminated by modern security lighting.

Castel Sant'Angelo rose above them like a stone monument to the kind of institutional power that had been shaping European politics for millennia, which felt appropriate given that they were apparently investigating a conspiracy that involved institutions with similar longevity. The tourist crowds were long gone, leaving the area around the fortress quiet except for the distant sound of Rome traffic and the occasional footsteps of security patrols.

"I still think this is a terrible idea," Claire said quietly, adjusting the small recording device Julian had acquired through methods she'd decided not to inquire about.

"It's definitely a terrible idea," Julian agreed, scanning the area with the kind of systematic attention that suggested he was cataloging potential threats and escape routes. "But it's also our only lead on who's been orchestrating this conspiracy."

"Our only lead is a text message from someone claiming to be 'a friend' who wants to meet in a location that's perfect for ambushes."

"Which is why we're not actually going to the location they specified."

Claire looked at him with the kind of expression usually reserved for people who'd just announced they were planning to rewrite established academic protocols. "What do you mean we're not going to the specified location?"

"I mean we're going to observe the specified location from a position that offers better tactical advantages." Julian pointed toward a section of the ancient wall that overlooked the main courtyard. "If someone shows up who actually wants to help us, we can approach them. If someone shows up who wants to capture us, we can leave."

"And if no one shows up?"

"Then we'll have learned something about our mysterious correspondent's commitment to this meeting."

They made their way to Julian's chosen observation point, which required climbing over several barriers that were probably designed to keep tourists from accessing structurally questionable sections of ancient masonry. Claire found herself grateful for eight years of navigating Vatican architecture, though she suspected her cardiovascular fitness was getting more of a workout than usual.

"Julian," she said as they settled into position behind a section of wall that provided both concealment and a clear view of the courtyard below, "I need to ask you something."

"What's that?"

"This message specifically asked me to come alone. Why would someone want to separate us?"

Julian was quiet for a moment, studying the empty courtyard with an expression that suggested he was calculating multiple possibilities. "Because they know something about my background that makes them reluctant to meet with me directly."

"What kind of background?"

"The kind that involves six centuries of vampire politics and a reputation for being... difficult to manipulate."

Before Claire could ask for clarification, a figure appeared in the courtyard below. Tall, elegant, moving with the kind of fluid grace that immediately identified them as supernatural rather than human. They were alone, which suggested either confidence or significant backup positioned out of sight.

"Do you recognize them?" Claire whispered.

Julian went very still beside her. "Yes," he said quietly. "That's Lucienne Bathory."

"Bathory? As in the Hungarian countess whoâ€”"

"As in one of the most powerful vampire bloodlines in Eastern Europe, and someone I haven't spoken to in approximately two centuries."

Claire felt pieces clicking into place with the kind of systematic precision that usually accompanied her best historical research. "Julian, what happened two centuries ago?"

"A disagreement about the implementation of certain Concordium provisions."

"What kind of disagreement?"

"The kind that resulted in approximately forty deaths and a diplomatic crisis that took three years to resolve."

Claire looked down at Lucienne Bathory, who was standing in the center of the courtyard with the kind of patient stillness that suggested she was prepared to wait indefinitely for her mysterious correspondent to appear.

"And now she wants to meet with me specifically," Claire said.

"Which suggests that either she's involved in the current conspiracy, or she has information about who is."

"Or both."

"Or both."

Claire studied Lucienne's posture and positioning, trying to read the situation with the same analytical approach she brought to complicated historical documents. "She's alone. That either means she's confident she can handle whatever threats she might encounter, or she's genuinely trying to communicate rather than capture."

"With Lucienne, those aren't mutually exclusive possibilities."

"What do you think we should do?"

Julian was quiet for a long moment, clearly weighing competing risks and benefits. "I think," he said finally, "that we need information more than we need safety."

"Meaning?"

"Meaning we go down there and find out what she wants."

They made their way back down to the courtyard, moving with the kind of careful stealth that Julian seemed to consider normal and Claire found genuinely nerve-wracking. When they emerged from the shadows, Lucienne turned toward them with an expression that suggested she'd been aware of their presence the entire time.

"Julian," she said, and her voice carried a slight accent that might have been Hungarian or might have been the result of speaking multiple languages for several centuries. "How delightfully unexpected."

"Lucienne." Julian's tone was carefully neutral in the way that suggested a long history of complicated interactions. "I wasn't expecting to see you in Rome."

"I wasn't expecting to be in Rome. But circumstances have required some... adjustments to my usual activities." Lucienne's attention shifted to Claire with the kind of systematic evaluation that made her feel like she was being cataloged for future reference. "Dr. Mercier, I presume?"

"Yes," Claire said, surprised by how steady her voice sounded. "Though I'm not sure how you know who I am."

"Your work has been quite valuable to those of us who prefer accurate historical context for our political decisions. Your documentation of supernatural incidents has helped several of us understand patterns that might otherwise have gone unnoticed."

Claire felt that familiar academic excitement override her concern about meeting with powerful supernatural entities in ancient Roman fortresses. "What kind of patterns?"

"Patterns suggesting that someone has been systematically manipulating both Church and bloodline records to create false historical precedents for political actions."

Julian moved slightly closer to Claire, positioning himself in a way that would allow him to respond quickly if the conversation became dangerous. "What kind of political actions?"

"The kind that would justify either the Church or the bloodlines claiming that the other party has been violating Concordium agreements for decades." Lucienne began walking slowly around the courtyard, her movement suggesting restless energy rather than aggressive intent. "Julian, how much do you know about recent activities within the Central European bloodlines?"

"Very little. I've been focused on Western European and Vatican relations."

"That may have been a mistake."

Claire felt something cold settle in her stomach. "What do you mean?"

"I mean that Amon has been building alliances with bloodlines that have historically remained neutral in supernatural politics. Bloodlines that control significant territory and resources across Eastern Europe."

"For what purpose?" Julian asked.

"For the purpose of ensuring that if the Concordium agreements collapse, vampire society has the political and military resources necessary to negotiate new agreements from a position of strength rather than desperation."

Claire processed this information with the same systematic approach she used for all complex political situations. "He's not just trying to start a war. He's trying to ensure vampires win it."

"He's trying to ensure that when new agreements are negotiated, they reflect what he considers to be the natural order of supernatural society."

"Which is?"

"Vampire supremacy with human society relegated to a subordinate position."

Julian's expression had grown increasingly troubled. "Lucienne, how many bloodlines are involved in this alliance?"

"Unknown. But enough to control most of Eastern Europe from Vienna to Budapest to Prague."

"And they're all committed to Amon's vision of supernatural politics?"

"They're all committed to the belief that the current agreements don't adequately protect vampire interests." Lucienne stopped walking and faced them directly. "Julian, some of these bloodlines have been documenting what they consider to be Church violations of Concordium provisions for decades."

"What kind of violations?"

"Unauthorized weapons development. Surveillance activities that exceed agreed-upon limits. Political interference in supernatural community affairs."

Claire felt pieces clicking into place with alarming speed. "Someone has been providing evidence of Church violations to justify vampire retaliation."

"Someone has been manufacturing evidence of Church violations," Lucienne corrected. "Evidence that appears legitimate but has been carefully constructed to support specific political narratives."

"The same way someone has been modifying the Concordium Scroll to create ambiguity about the actual terms of the agreements," Julian said.

"Precisely."

Claire looked between Julian and Lucienne, both of whom clearly understood implications of supernatural politics that were still beyond her expertise. "So we have someone who's been manipulating both sides to believe the other is violating their agreements, while simultaneously modifying the foundational document to create confusion about what those agreements actually require."

"That would be an accurate assessment," Lucienne agreed.

"And Amon is either the architect of this manipulation, or he's being manipulated by whoever the actual architect is."

"Also accurate."

Julian studied Lucienne with an expression that suggested he was evaluating both her information and her motivations. "Lucienne, why are you telling us this?"

"Because I've spent the last six months investigating these patterns, and I've discovered something that concerns me more than the possibility of renewed supernatural conflict."

"What's that?"

"I've discovered that whoever is orchestrating this manipulation has access to bloodline records and Church archives that should be impossible to obtain without institutional cooperation."

Claire felt the implications hit her with the force of a complete paradigm shift. "You're saying there are people within both the Church and vampire society who are actively working to destabilize the agreements."

"I'm saying there are people within both communities who believe that the current agreements serve their enemies more than they protect their interests, and who are willing to orchestrate a controlled collapse to ensure that new agreements better serve their goals."

"A controlled collapse?"

"A supernatural conflict that ends with specific parties in positions to dictate the terms of whatever replaces the Concordium Scroll."

Julian was quiet for a long moment, clearly processing the full scope of what Lucienne was describing. "Lucienne," he said finally, "what do you need from us?"

"I need Dr. Mercier's expertise in medieval Church-vampire relations to help me understand the historical precedents being used to justify current political actions. And I need your connections within both communities to help me identify who has the access and resources necessary to orchestrate this kind of manipulation."

"And in exchange?"

"In exchange, I provide you with access to the Central European bloodlines and their intelligence networks. I also provide you with protection from Amon's allies, which you're going to need more than you realize."

Claire looked at Julian, who was clearly calculating the risks and benefits of allying with someone he hadn't spoken to in two centuries due to a disagreement that had resulted in forty deaths.

"Julian," she said quietly, "what do you think?"

"I think," he said slowly, "that we need allies more than we need certainty about their motivations."

"And I think we need information more than we need safety," Claire added.

Lucienne smiled, and Claire caught a glimpse of fangs that confirmed several hypotheses about Bathory family genetics. "In that case," she said, "I suggest we continue this conversation in Vienna. I have resources there that will allow us to investigate the Central European connections without attracting unwanted attention."

"Vienna," Claire said.

"Vienna," Lucienne confirmed. "Where the real political decisions about vampire society have been made for the past three centuries."

As they made arrangements for travel that would probably involve more supernatural logistics than conventional transportation, Claire found herself thinking that her understanding of European supernatural politics was about to undergo significant expansion.
