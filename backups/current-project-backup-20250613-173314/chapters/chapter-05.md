# Chapter 5: The Cardinal's Gambit

*Later that morning, Vatican City*

---

Claire had always believed that knowledge was power, but she'd never considered the possibility that knowledge could also be a weapon pointed directly at her head.

The folder Cardinal Torretti had left contained exactly the kind of information that would have fascinated her under normal circumstances: detailed profiles of vampire bloodlines, maps of territorial agreements, correspondence between Church officials and supernatural entities dating back to the Renaissance. Under normal circumstances, she would have spent weeks analyzing the historical patterns and cross-referencing the political implications.

These were not normal circumstances.

"This is a recruitment file," she said, sliding the folder across her desk to Julian. "He's not trying to get my help investigating the theft. He's trying to get my cooperation in whatever the Church is planning to do about it."

Julian flipped through the documents with the kind of systematic attention that suggested he was cataloging everything for future reference. "The territorial maps are current," he said. "Updated within the last month. The bloodline profiles include information that's not supposed to be available to Church officials."

"Meaning?"

"Meaning someone has been conducting surveillance on vampire society with remarkable thoroughness." Julian's expression had grown increasingly troubled as he read. "Claire, some of this information could only have come from inside the bloodlines themselves."

Claire felt that familiar academic excitement override her growing concern about their situation. "You're talking about espionage. Someone in vampire society has been feeding information to the Church."

"Someone in vampire society has been preparing for this situation for months, possibly years." Julian closed the folder and looked at her directly. "The question is whether they've been preparing for diplomatic negotiations or something significantly more aggressive."

Before Claire could respond, her office phone rang. The caller ID showed an internal Vatican extension she didn't recognize.

"Miss Mercier," she answered.

"Miss Mercier, this is Cardinal Torretti. I trust you've had time to review the materials I provided?"

Claire exchanged glances with Julian, who had gone very still in a way that suggested he was calculating escape routes.

"I've reviewed them, Your Eminence. They're quite comprehensive."

"Excellent. I wonder if you might join me in my office? There are some additional aspects of the situation that require immediate discussion."

"Of course. When would be convenient?"

"Now would be convenient."

The line went dead.

"He wants to see me immediately," Claire said.

"Don't go," Julian said quietly. "Claire, Cardinal Torretti is not conducting a standard diplomatic consultation. He's evaluating you as either an asset or a threat, and I suspect he's already reached his conclusion."

"What kind of conclusion?"

"The kind that results in people disappearing from their positions with remarkable efficiency and no public explanation."

Claire felt something cold settle in her stomach. "You're saying he might actually be dangerous? He's a Cardinal. This is the Vatican."

"He's someone claiming to be a Cardinal in an institution that has been managing supernatural politics for six centuries," Julian corrected. "The Vatican you think you know is only part of the reality."

Claire looked at the folder, then at Julian, then at her office door beyond which Cardinal Torretti was waiting for an answer that could determine the rest of her career and quite possibly her life.

"If I don't go, he'll know we're working together."

"If you do go, you may not come back."

"And if I run?"

"Then we both run. Together."

Something in Julian's voice made Claire look at him more carefully. The formal politeness was still there, but underneath it she could see something that looked remarkably like protective concern.

"Julian," she said quietly, "what exactly are you suggesting?"

"I'm suggesting that Cardinal Torretti represents a faction within the Church that has decided the current Concordium agreements are no longer satisfactory. I'm suggesting that the theft of the scroll was not unauthorized—it was orchestrated. And I'm suggesting that you've been identified as someone who knows enough to be useful but not enough to be dangerous."

"Until now."

"Until now."

Claire felt pieces clicking into place with the kind of systematic precision that usually accompanied her best historical research. "The scroll wasn't stolen. It was moved deliberately to create the appearance of theft, so the Church could justify modifying the agreements without consulting the bloodlines."

"That would be my assessment."

"And Cardinal Torretti wants my expertise to provide academic legitimacy for whatever changes they're planning to make."

"While simultaneously ensuring that the bloodlines' attempts to recover their foundational legal document are unsuccessful."

Claire stood up, moving to the window that looked out over St. Peter's Square. Hundreds of tourists were moving through the plaza, taking photographs and admiring the architecture, completely unaware that a few floors below them, a conspiracy that could reshape the balance between human and supernatural society was playing out in real time.

"What happens if the bloodlines can't recover the scroll?"

"Depends on how long they're willing to maintain diplomatic relations without their foundational legal protections," Julian said. "Some bloodlines will attempt to negotiate new agreements. Others will consider the truce void and act accordingly."

"What does 'act accordingly' mean?"

Julian's smile was sharp enough to remind her that despite their growing partnership, he was still fundamentally a predator who had survived for six centuries.

"It means that the Church's ability to maintain supernatural secrecy will be tested in ways that may prove... illuminating for human society."

Claire's phone rang again.

"Miss Mercier," Cardinal Torretti's voice carried a subtle edge that suggested his patience was limited. "I'm waiting."

"I'll be right there, Your Eminence."

She hung up and turned to Julian. "I have to go. If I don't, he'll send someone to find out why, and that someone will find you here."

"Then we leave. Now. Together."

"And go where? Julian, I don't know how to be a fugitive. I don't know how to live outside institutional structures. I catalog supernatural incidents for a living—I don't actually participate in them."

Julian stood up, moving to stand beside her at the window. "Claire," he said quietly, "you've been participating in supernatural politics since the moment you decided to help me instead of calling security. The question now is whether you're going to participate as someone with agency or as someone being manipulated by forces beyond her control."

Claire looked down at St. Peter's Square, then at the folder containing information that could rewrite everything she thought she knew about the institution she'd dedicated her career to serving.

"If we run, we'll never be able to come back."

"If we don't run, we may not survive long enough for coming back to be an option."

Claire's phone rang a third time.

"Miss Mercier." Cardinal Torretti's voice had lost all pretense of politeness. "I'm sending someone to escort you to my office. Please be ready."

The line went dead.

"That was definitely a threat," Claire said.

"That was definitely a threat," Julian agreed.

Claire could hear footsteps in the corridor outside her office. Multiple sets of footsteps, moving with the kind of purposeful coordination that suggested military or security training.

"Julian," she said, turning away from the window, "I need you to understand something. I've spent my entire adult life building a career based on institutional trust and academic precision. Running away from the Vatican with a vampire to investigate supernatural conspiracy theories is not exactly in my comfort zone."

"I understand."

"But I also need you to understand that I've spent eight years cataloging evidence of supernatural politics, and I'm not prepared to let someone manipulate that information to start a war between communities that have managed to coexist for six centuries."

Julian smiled, and this time it reached his eyes. "Miss Mercier," he said, "I believe you've just chosen sides."

The footsteps stopped outside her office door.

"Dr. Mercier?" The voice was male, young, carrying the kind of authority that suggested Vatican security personnel. "Cardinal Torretti requests your immediate presence."

Claire looked at Julian, who had moved to the window with the fluid grace that reminded her he was capable of things that defied normal human limitations.

"How do you feel about unconventional exit strategies?" he asked quietly.

"I feel like my definition of unconventional is about to undergo significant revision," she replied.

"Dr. Mercier?" The voice outside her door carried more insistence. "Please respond."

Claire made a decision that she was fairly certain would redefine the rest of her life.

"I'm sorry," she called through the door, "but I'm going to have to decline Cardinal Torretti's invitation."

The response was immediate and unambiguous. The office door handle turned, and Claire heard the distinctive sound of someone testing a lock that wasn't going to hold for very long.

"Window," Julian said.

"We're three stories up."

"I'm aware of the elevation."

"Julian, I can't—"

"You can. Trust me."

Claire looked at the door, which was beginning to show signs that whoever was on the other side had tools specifically designed for rapid entry, then at Julian, who was holding out his hand with an expression that suggested he was asking her to make a leap of faith in more ways than one.

"If we do this," she said, "there's no going back."

"If we don't do this, there may be no going forward."

The door opened.

Two men in dark suits entered her office with the kind of systematic efficiency that suggested extensive training in persuasion techniques that didn't rely on politeness. Behind them, Cardinal Torretti appeared in the doorway, his expression carrying a mixture of disappointment and calculation.

"Dr. Mercier," he said, "I had hoped we could resolve this situation through cooperation."

"Your Eminence," Claire said, still standing beside Julian at the window, "I had hoped you were actually interested in historical research rather than supernatural politics."

"The two are not mutually exclusive." Cardinal Torretti stepped into the office, his gaze taking in Julian's presence with no visible surprise. "Mr. St. Claire, I presume? Your reputation precedes you."

Julian inclined his head with perfect formal courtesy. "Your Eminence. Though I confess I'm unfamiliar with your position within the Church hierarchy."

"My position is to ensure that supernatural relations proceed in ways that serve the interests of human society."

"And if those interests conflict with existing agreements?"

"Then existing agreements may require... revision."

Claire felt the last of her institutional loyalty evaporate. "You orchestrated the theft of the Concordium Scroll."

"I orchestrated the protection of a document that was being used to limit the Church's ability to respond appropriately to changing political circumstances."

"Those political circumstances being the inconvenient reality that vampire society has rights under existing treaties?"

Cardinal Torretti's smile suggested that her understanding of the situation was both accurate and irrelevant.

"Dr. Mercier," he said, "you have expertise that could be invaluable in negotiating new agreements that better serve contemporary needs. Mr. St. Claire has perspective that could help his people understand the benefits of enhanced cooperation. I'm offering you both the opportunity to participate in shaping the future of supernatural-human relations."

"And if we decline?" Julian asked.

"Then you'll discover that the Church's commitment to diplomatic solutions has certain practical limitations."

The two men in suits moved closer, positioning themselves between Claire and Julian and the office door. Their posture suggested that physical persuasion was an acceptable option if verbal persuasion proved insufficient.

Claire looked at Cardinal Torretti, who clearly represented institutional power that could destroy her career and quite possibly her life, then at Julian, who represented possibilities she'd never imagined and dangers she couldn't fully comprehend.

"Your Eminence," she said, "I'm going to have to decline your offer."

"I'm afraid that's not an option."

Julian moved.

Claire had read descriptions of vampire speed in her research, but experiencing it firsthand was something else entirely. One moment he was standing beside her at the window; the next, both men in suits were unconscious on her office floor and Cardinal Torretti was backing toward the door with an expression that suggested his calculations about the situation had been insufficiently comprehensive.

"Mr. St. Claire," he said carefully, "violence is not necessary."

"I agree," Julian said. "Which is why Dr. Mercier and I are going to leave peacefully, and you're going to allow us to do so."

"I'm afraid I can't do that."

"Then I'm afraid you've misunderstood the nature of this negotiation."

Cardinal Torretti reached inside his jacket, withdrawing what looked like a small silver crucifix. "Mr. St. Claire, the Church has been dealing with your kind for centuries. We're not unprepared for situations like this."

Julian paused, studying the crucifix with what might have been professional interest. "Blessed silver. Thirteenth-century design. Quite effective, under normal circumstances."

"These are normal circumstances."

"Your Eminence," Julian said politely, "you appear to be laboring under the misconception that I'm a typical vampire operating under standard limitations."

He moved again, and the crucifix went flying across the room to embed itself in the stone wall with enough force to crack the ancient masonry.

Cardinal Torretti stared at the crucifix, then at Julian, with an expression that suggested his understanding of supernatural capabilities had just undergone significant revision.

"What are you?" he asked quietly.

"I'm someone who helped negotiate the original Concordium agreements," Julian said. "Which means I'm someone who understands exactly what's at stake if those agreements fail."

He turned to Claire, extending his hand. "Dr. Mercier, I believe it's time for that unconventional exit strategy."

Claire looked at her office—which contained eight years of careful academic work, a career's worth of institutional relationships, and everything she'd built her adult life around—then at Julian's offered hand.

"If we do this," she said, "everything changes."

"Everything has already changed," Julian replied. "The only question is whether we change with it."

Claire took his hand.

"Hold tight," he said, and opened the window.

As they disappeared into the Roman afternoon, leaving behind Cardinal Torretti and the unconscious security personnel and eight years of carefully catalogued impossible things, Claire found herself thinking that her definition of "academic research" had just undergone the most significant revision of her career.
