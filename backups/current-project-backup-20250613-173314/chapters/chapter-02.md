# Chapter 2: The Wounded Intruder

*Continuing from late evening, Vatican City*

---

Claire had cataloged approximately forty-seven thousand impossible things in her professional career, but she'd never actually expected to encounter one in person.

The screaming sound echoed through the stone corridors again, closer this time, and definitely not mechanical. Father Calder's fingers flew across the security panel, pulling up camera feeds from the restricted sections with an efficiency that suggested he'd done this before.

"Sector Seven," he muttered, and Claire caught the edge of something that might have been fear or might have been resignation. "Of course it's Sector Seven."

"What's in Sector Seven?" Claire asked, moving to stand beside him at the panel. The security monitors showed a maze of corridors lined with vault doors, each one secured with enough locks and sensors to protect nuclear secrets. Most of the feeds showed empty hallways bathed in the red glow of emergency lighting.

"The Concordium vault."

Claire felt her pulse spike with a mixture of academic excitement and genuine alarm. "Someone's trying to break into the Concordium vault?"

"Not trying," Father Calder said grimly, pointing to one of the monitors. "Succeeding."

The camera feed showed a corridor that should have been empty. Instead, a figure moved through the red-tinged darkness with impossible speed and grace, passing through what appeared to be solid barriers as if they were made of paper. The image quality was poor—the figure seemed to blur at the edges, as if the camera couldn't quite focus—but Claire could make out enough to see that whoever it was, they were leaving a trail of what looked disturbingly like blood along the pristine white walls.

"How is that possible?" she asked. "Those barriers are reinforced steel. The locks are biometric. The entire section is warded with—"

She stopped mid-sentence, suddenly aware that she'd been about to reference security measures that she shouldn't technically know about. Father Calder's expression suggested he'd noticed her slip.

"Warded with what, Claire?"

Heat crept up her neck. "I may have done some additional research into archive security protocols. For academic purposes."

"Academic purposes."

"I wanted to understand the preservation systems. It's important for proper cataloging to know how documents are protected from... environmental threats."

Father Calder studied her with the same expression he wore when she'd tried to convince him that staying until midnight was a reasonable working schedule. "Environmental threats like humidity, temperature fluctuations, and supernatural entities attempting unauthorized access?"

"Exactly," Claire said, then paused. "Wait. Did you just admit that supernatural entities actually exist?"

Before Father Calder could respond, the lights went out completely.

Emergency power kicked in a moment later, bathing everything in the same red glow Claire had seen on the security feeds. The alarm continued its urgent wailing, and somewhere in the distance, she could hear the distinctive sound of metal being torn apart.

"We need to evacuate," Father Calder said, moving toward the chamber's main exit with surprising speed for a man his age.

"We need to investigate," Claire corrected, moving in the opposite direction toward the restricted access corridor. "If someone is breaking into the Concordium vault, we need to know what they're after and why they think they can—"

"Claire, no."

The sharp authority in Father Calder's voice stopped her mid-step. She'd never heard him use that tone before, and something about it made her suddenly aware that she might be significantly more naive about her working environment than she'd realized.

"Father, what exactly aren't you telling me?"

"Everything," he said quietly. "I'm not telling you everything, and right now, I need you to trust me enough to leave this building immediately."

Claire looked at him—really looked at him—and saw past the gentle, scholarly exterior to something harder underneath. Something that had clearly made difficult decisions before and was prepared to make them again.

She also saw that he was afraid. Not concerned, not worried, but genuinely, deeply afraid.

"The intruder isn't human," she said. It wasn't a question.

Father Calder's silence was answer enough.

Claire felt something shift inside her chest, a fundamental recalibration of everything she thought she knew about her life. For eight years, she'd cataloged evidence of supernatural encounters with the detached precision of an academic. She'd treated vampire sightings and demonic possessions the way other historians treated trade agreements and succession disputes—as interesting phenomena that had happened to other people in other times.

The possibility that these things might be happening *now*, in her world, in her workplace, had never seriously occurred to her.

"What is it?" she asked.

"I don't know," Father Calder said, and she could hear the truth in his voice. "But whoever it is, they bypassed security measures that should have stopped anything short of a military assault. They're looking for something specific in the Concordium vault, and they were willing to risk exposure to get it."

The sound of tearing metal grew louder, accompanied by something that might have been footsteps if footsteps could move that quickly and sound that precise.

"We should call for help," Claire said.

"Who exactly would you suggest we call? The Vatican Guard? The Swiss Army? The local police?" Father Calder's voice carried a bitter edge she'd never heard before. "There are very few people in this world who are equipped to handle supernatural incursions, Claire, and most of them are either dead or have excellent reasons for not wanting to be found."

Claire processed this information with the same systematic approach she used for everything else that challenged her understanding of reality. "So we're on our own."

"We're on our own."

"In that case," she said, reaching for the emergency flashlight mounted near the security panel, "we should probably figure out what they want before they get it."

"Claire—"

"You said they're looking for something specific in the Concordium vault. I've been tracking references to the Concordium Scroll across six centuries of documentation. If that's what they're after, I might be the only person in this building who understands its significance."

Father Calder stared at her with an expression that suggested he was reassessing everything he thought he knew about her character. "Your curiosity really will be the death of me."

"My curiosity is the only chance we have of understanding what's happening," Claire corrected, already moving toward the restricted access corridor. "Besides, I've spent eight years reading about this kind of thing. How dangerous could it actually be?"

The answer came in the form of a sound that made every instinct Claire possessed scream at her to run in the opposite direction. It started as a low growl, deep and resonant enough to vibrate through the stone walls, then shifted into something that was unmistakably a voice. A male voice, speaking words in a language she didn't recognize, carrying an undertone of controlled fury and desperate pain.

"Apparently," she said quietly, "significantly more dangerous than I thought."

But instead of running, she found herself moving forward, flashlight beam cutting through the red-tinged darkness as she navigated the maze of corridors that led to the restricted sections. Behind her, she could hear Father Calder following, muttering what sounded like prayers in Latin.

The voice grew clearer as they approached Sector Seven, and Claire realized with a shock that she could understand some of the words. Not because she recognized the language, but because her mind seemed to be translating automatically, as if the speaker's meaning was being transmitted directly into her consciousness.

*Where is it? Where is the scroll? They promised it would be here...*

"He's looking for the Concordium Scroll," she whispered to Father Calder.

"How can you understand him?"

"I have no idea."

They reached the entrance to Sector Seven, and Claire could see that the reinforced security door had been torn apart with surgical precision. The edges of the metal were clean, as if they'd been cut with a laser, but she could see what looked like claw marks in the surrounding stone.

The voice continued, closer now, and Claire could hear the pain underneath the anger.

*Six hundred years. Six hundred years of faithful service, and this is how they repay trust. Where is it?*

"Six hundred years," Claire repeated softly. "Father, what lives for six hundred years?"

"Nothing that should be awake in the twenty-first century," Father Calder said grimly.

They moved deeper into Sector Seven, following the trail of damaged security barriers and the increasingly desperate sound of the voice. Claire's flashlight beam revealed walls lined with vault doors, each one bearing labels in multiple languages. Most were still sealed, but she could see that several had been forced open, their contents scattered across the floor.

Ancient parchments. Medieval artifacts. Things that looked suspiciously like ceremonial weapons.

And blood. Definitely blood, dark and fresh, marking a path toward the end of the corridor where a massive vault door stood partially open.

*The Concordium vault.*

"He found it," Claire whispered.

They approached carefully, and Claire could hear the voice more clearly now. The speaker was definitely male, and definitely in pain, but there was something else in his tone that she couldn't quite identify. Desperation, yes, but also a kind of aristocratic authority, as if he was accustomed to being obeyed.

*Empty. The vault is empty. How is this possible?*

Claire exchanged glances with Father Calder. "The vault is empty?"

"It shouldn't be," he said quietly. "There should be documents in there that... that certain parties would very much like to keep confidential."

*Documents that have been moved. Hidden. By whom? And why?*

"He knows we're here," Claire realized. "He's not talking to himself. He's talking to us."

Father Calder grabbed her arm. "We need to leave. Now."

But before they could move, a figure appeared in the vault doorway.

Claire's first thought was that her flashlight must be malfunctioning, because the beam seemed to bend around the man standing in front of them. Her second thought was that she was hallucinating, because no one could move with that kind of fluid, predatory grace while clearly suffering from significant blood loss.

Her third thought was that she was probably about to die, and it was a shame she'd never gotten to see what was actually in the Concordium vault.

The man—because he was definitely a man, despite the impossible speed and grace—stepped into the corridor, and Claire's flashlight beam finally caught him properly.

He was tall, probably six-two or six-three, with dark hair that looked like he'd been running his hands through it and pale skin that seemed to absorb light rather than reflect it. His clothes were expensive—a black wool coat over what looked like a perfectly tailored shirt—but both were torn and bloodstained. Most importantly, he was bleeding from what appeared to be several serious wounds, dark stains spreading across his shirt and coat with alarming speed.

He should have been unconscious. He should probably have been dead.

Instead, he looked at Claire with eyes that seemed to shift between human warmth and something entirely inhuman, and spoke in perfect, slightly accented English.

"I apologize for the intrusion," he said, and his voice carried the same aristocratic authority she'd heard before, though now she could detect the careful control it was taking him to speak calmly. "I was under the impression that the Concordium vault contained documents related to certain... historical agreements. It appears I was misinformed."

Claire stared at him, her academic mind cataloging details with automatic precision while every survival instinct she possessed screamed contradictory advice.

"You're bleeding," she said, which wasn't the most intellectually rigorous response she'd ever given but seemed like the most immediate concern.

Something that might have been surprise flickered across his features. "Yes. I am."

"You should probably sit down before you collapse."

"That would be... prudent," he agreed, and Claire could hear the effort it was taking him to maintain his polite tone.

Father Calder stepped forward, placing himself slightly between Claire and the stranger. "Who are you? What do you want with the Concordium documents?"

The man's gaze shifted to Father Calder, and Claire saw his expression harden. "I want what was promised to my people six centuries ago, Father. I want the agreements that were made, the terms that were negotiated, and the guarantees that have apparently been... misplaced."

"I don't know what you're talking about."

"Don't you?" The man took a step forward, and Claire could see that his movements, while still graceful, were becoming less steady. "The Concordium Scroll, Father. The document that outlined the terms of the truce between the Church and the bloodlines. The agreement that has kept both our peoples alive for six hundred years, and which appears to have been stolen."

Claire felt her academic excitement override her survival instincts. "The bloodlines? You're talking about vampire bloodlines?"

Both men turned to look at her with expressions of surprise.

"You told her about the bloodlines?" the stranger asked Father Calder.

"She figured it out on her own," Father Calder said defensively. "She's been researching supernatural incidents for eight years. She was bound to notice patterns eventually."

"And you are?" the stranger asked, focusing his attention on Claire with an intensity that made her suddenly aware that predators evaluated their environment very differently than prey.

"Claire Mercier," she said, surprised by how steady her voice sounded. "I'm the senior archivist for supernatural documentation."

"Ah." Something that might have been relief crossed his features. "An archivist. Then perhaps you can help me understand how a document of vital importance to the survival of multiple species has simply... vanished."

"I would need to know more about the document's classification, storage protocols, and access history," Claire said, falling back on professional competence because everything else felt too surreal to process. "I'd also need to understand the current political context, since you mentioned that the agreements are still active."

The stranger studied her with an expression that suggested he was reassessing his initial assumptions about her competence and potential usefulness.

"My name is Julian St. Claire," he said formally. "I represent certain... concerned parties who have a vested interest in maintaining the agreements outlined in the Concordium Scroll. Three days ago, we were informed that the document had been removed from its secure location and was being held here for verification and safe keeping. Tonight, I came to retrieve it."

"And instead you found an empty vault," Claire said.

"Indeed."

"Which suggests that either the information you received was incorrect, or the document has been moved again."

"Both possibilities are... troubling."

Claire looked at Julian St. Claire—who was almost certainly not human, was definitely some kind of supernatural entity, and was apparently bleeding to death in front of her—and felt her analytical mind engage with the same focused intensity it brought to particularly complex historical mysteries.

"Mr. St. Claire," she said, "I think we need to have a conversation about supernatural politics, missing documents, and why someone appears to be playing both sides of a six-hundred-year-old treaty against each other."

Julian smiled, and Claire caught a glimpse of fangs that confirmed several hypotheses about his species classification.

"Miss Mercier," he said, "I believe you may be the first person in decades to understand the true scope of this problem."

Then he collapsed.

Claire found herself kneeling beside him before she'd consciously decided to move, her hands automatically checking for a pulse while her mind raced through first aid protocols and the unsettling realization that she had no idea how vampire physiology worked.

"Father," she said quietly, "I think we're going to need that conversation about ongoing supernatural arrangements sooner than expected."

Behind her, Father Calder sighed deeply.

"Claire," he said, "I think you're about to discover that some knowledge really is dangerous."

But as she knelt beside Julian St. Claire in the red-tinged emergency lighting of the Vatican's most secure archive, watching a centuries-old vampire trust her enough to lose consciousness in her presence, Claire found herself thinking that dangerous knowledge was still knowledge.
