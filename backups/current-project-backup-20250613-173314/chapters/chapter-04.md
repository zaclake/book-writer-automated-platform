# Chapter 4: Secrets and Lies

*The next morning, Vatican City*

---

Claire had always found that the best time to conduct unauthorized research was during the morning shift change, when the archives were temporarily understaffed and security protocols were at their most flexible. What she hadn't counted on was conducting that research with a six-hundred-year-old vampire who had strong opinions about proper citation methods.

"The 1347 negotiations weren't concluded in Venice," Julian said quietly, reading over her shoulder as she scrolled through the restricted database. "They were initiated there, but the actual treaty was signed in Avignon."

"The records say Venice," Claire pointed out, though she made a note to cross-reference with Papal court documents from Avignon.

"The records," Julian said with what might have been amusement, "were deliberately falsified to misdirect future researchers. The Church has been revising supernatural history for centuries."

Claire paused her typing and turned to look at him. Julian was seated in the chair normally reserved for visiting scholars, looking remarkably composed for someone who'd been bleeding to death in a Vatican vault twelve hours earlier. His clothes were clean—Father Calder had somehow procured a replacement shirt and coat—and the wounds on his shoulder and ribs were already showing signs of significant healing.

Vampire physiology, she'd decided, was either miraculous or deeply unsettling, depending on your perspective.

"You're telling me that the historical record I've been using for eight years is deliberately inaccurate?"

"I'm telling you that the Church's official documentation of supernatural events has always prioritized discretion over accuracy. Which, considering the political complexities involved, is probably understandable."

Claire felt that familiar academic frustration that came with discovering that sources she'd trusted were compromised. "How much of what I've cataloged is actually true?"

"The events themselves are generally accurate," Julian said. "The locations, dates, and participants have been systematically altered to prevent anyone from reconstructing the actual political relationships."

"So I've been building a historical framework based on deliberate misinformation."

"You've been building a historical framework based on the information you were given access to. There's a difference."

Claire appreciated that he wasn't making her feel foolish for trusting institutional sources, though she still felt like an idiot for not noticing the patterns of deliberate obfuscation earlier.

"What actually happened in 1347?" she asked.

Julian was quiet for a moment, his gaze fixed on something beyond the computer screen. "The plague was worse than human records indicate," he said finally. "Not just in terms of mortality, but in terms of the supernatural forces that were amplifying its effects. There were... entities involved that fed on death and despair. The more people died, the stronger they became."

"What kind of entities?"

"The kind that no longer exist, thanks to a cooperative effort between the Church and several vampire bloodlines." Julian's expression suggested this was not a pleasant memory, even from a distance of nearly seven centuries. "The negotiations weren't about recognition or legitimacy. They were about survival. Both species."

Claire made notes as he spoke, cross-referencing with the official records and noting discrepancies. "The Church records mention payment in the form of legitimacy. You're saying it was actually a mutual defense alliance?"

"The Church needed supernatural assistance to identify and eliminate the entities that were amplifying the plague. The vampire bloodlines needed Church resources to coordinate the effort across multiple countries. The 'payment' was an agreement to establish diplomatic protocols for future cooperation."

"And those protocols became the Concordium Scroll."

"The Concordium Scroll codified the terms under which both communities agreed to coexist. Territorial boundaries, feeding restrictions, exposure protocols, enforcement mechanisms." Julian's voice carried the weight of someone who'd helped negotiate those terms personally. "It's not a treaty between equals. It's a carefully balanced arrangement that acknowledges the reality of supernatural society while maintaining human ignorance of that reality."

Claire felt pieces clicking into place with the satisfaction that came from solving particularly complex historical puzzles. "That's why the theft is so significant. Someone isn't just stealing a historical document. They're destabilizing the entire foundation of supernatural-human relations."

"Precisely."

"But why? Who would benefit from destabilizing that foundation?"

Julian's expression darkened. "Anyone who believes the current arrangement favors their enemies more than it protects them."

Before Claire could ask for clarification, she heard footsteps in the corridor outside her office. Measured, purposeful footsteps that suggested someone in authority was approaching with deliberate intent.

"Expecting visitors?" Julian asked, and Claire could hear the subtle tension that had crept into his voice.

"No," she said, quickly closing the database and switching to a more innocuous research screen. "Father Calder doesn't usually come in this early, and the other archivists work in different sections."

The footsteps stopped directly outside her office door.

"Miss Mercier?" The voice was unfamiliar—male, older, carrying the kind of authority that expected immediate compliance. "I wonder if I might have a word."

Claire exchanged glances with Julian, who had gone very still in a way that reminded her that despite his polite manner, he was fundamentally a predator assessing potential threats.

"Of course," she called, then lowered her voice to a whisper. "Storage closet. Now."

Julian moved with that impossible vampire speed, disappearing into the small storage area behind her desk just as the office door opened to reveal a man who looked like he'd been designed to embody ecclesiastical authority.

He was tall, probably in his fifties, with silver-touched dark hair and the kind of bearing that suggested he was accustomed to being the most important person in any room. His clerical collar was perfectly pressed, his black suit was expensive, and his eyes held the calculating intelligence of someone who had made a career out of managing difficult situations.

"Miss Mercier," he said, extending a hand. "Cardinal Alessandro Torretti. I don't believe we've been formally introduced."

Claire shook his hand, noting that his grip was firm but not aggressive, and that his smile didn't quite reach his eyes. "Your Eminence. I'm honored. How can I help you?"

"I understand there was some excitement in the archives last evening. A security breach of some kind?"

Claire felt her pulse spike, but kept her expression neutral. "Yes, there was an alarm. Father Calder and I investigated, but we didn't find any signs of actual intrusion. The system may have malfunctioned."

"Ah." Cardinal Torretti moved further into her office, his gaze taking in the computer screen, the research materials scattered across her desk, and the general organization of her workspace with the systematic attention of someone conducting an assessment. "And you found nothing missing? Nothing disturbed?"

"Nothing that we could identify," Claire said carefully. "Though I suppose a full inventory would take some time to complete."

"Of course." The Cardinal's attention focused on her computer screen, which currently displayed a search for fourteenth-century Papal documentation. "Researching the Avignon period, I see. Fascinating era. So much political complexity."

Claire felt something cold settle in her stomach. There was no innocent reason for a Cardinal to visit her office the morning after a break-in, ask about missing materials, and then comment on her current research. Which meant he either knew about Julian's presence last night, or he knew about the Concordium Scroll, or both.

"Yes," she said, falling back on professional competence. "I'm working on a comprehensive analysis of Church-supernatural relations during the medieval period. The political dynamics are remarkably complex."

"Church-supernatural relations." Cardinal Torretti's smile sharpened slightly. "An interesting research focus. I imagine you've encountered some rather... unusual documentation in your work."

"The archives contain records of many incidents that were considered supernatural at the time they occurred," Claire said, choosing her words carefully. "Whether they actually involved supernatural forces is, of course, a matter of interpretation."

"Of course." The Cardinal moved to examine the bookshelf behind her desk, and Claire realized with alarm that he was positioning himself directly between her and the storage closet where Julian was hidden. "Tell me, Miss Mercier, in your professional opinion, how seriously should the Church take claims of ongoing supernatural activity?"

This was definitely not a casual conversation. Cardinal Torretti was fishing for information, testing her knowledge, and quite possibly evaluating whether she represented a security risk.

"I think," Claire said carefully, "that the Church has always been wise to maintain detailed documentation of unusual events, regardless of their ultimate classification. Historical patterns can provide valuable insights."

"Historical patterns," the Cardinal repeated. "Yes, indeed they can. For instance, the pattern of supernatural entities seeking access to Church archives when they believe those archives contain information relevant to their interests."

Claire felt her heart rate spike, but forced herself to maintain eye contact. "I'm not sure I understand Your Eminence's meaning."

"Don't you?" Cardinal Torretti turned away from the bookshelf to study her directly. "Miss Mercier, I'm going to be frank with you. The Church is aware that certain... parties have been making inquiries about specific historical documents. We're also aware that these parties have resources and capabilities that could pose a significant threat to institutional security."

"What kind of parties?"

"The kind that live considerably longer than normal human lifespans and have strong opinions about historical accuracy." The Cardinal's smile was sharp enough to suggest he was done with subtle probing. "Now, if such parties were to approach someone with your expertise and request assistance in locating sensitive materials, what would your response be?"

Claire realized she was at a crossroads. She could claim ignorance, deflect with academic evasion, or tell the truth and potentially put Julian in immediate danger. Cardinal Torretti clearly knew more than he was saying, and her response was going to determine how this situation developed.

"Your Eminence," she said slowly, "if someone approached me seeking assistance with historical research, I would evaluate their request based on the legitimacy of their academic credentials and the institutional approval for their access to specific materials."

"And if their credentials were... unconventional?"

"I would consult with my supervisors about appropriate protocols."

"Appropriate protocols." Cardinal Torretti nodded as if she'd confirmed something he'd suspected. "Miss Mercier, what would you say if I told you that certain documents in our collection are not simply historical artifacts, but active legal instruments with ongoing political implications?"

Claire felt the last of her plausible deniability evaporate. "I would say that sounds like information significantly above my clearance level."

"It is. But circumstances may require us to expand your clearance level considerably." The Cardinal moved closer to her desk, and Claire caught a glimpse of what looked like a small silver medallion hanging from a chain around his neck. "Tell me, have you ever encountered evidence of what you might call 'ongoing supernatural arrangements' in your research?"

There was no point in pretending anymore. Cardinal Torretti knew about supernatural politics, he knew about the archives' true contents, and he almost certainly knew about Julian's presence last night.

"Yes," she said quietly.

"And what is your assessment of such arrangements?"

"That they appear to represent a complex balance of interests designed to maintain stability between different communities."

"Very diplomatic." Cardinal Torretti's expression suggested approval mixed with calculation. "Miss Mercier, I'm going to share some information with you that is not to leave this room under any circumstances. The Church maintains active diplomatic relationships with several supernatural communities. These relationships are governed by formal agreements that require periodic review and updating."

"The Concordium Scroll," Claire said.

Cardinal Torretti went very still. "You're familiar with that document?"

"I've encountered references to it in my research."

"I see." The Cardinal was quiet for a long moment, clearly recalculating whatever strategy he'd planned for this conversation. "Miss Mercier, the Concordium Scroll was moved from its usual location three weeks ago for security reasons. We have reason to believe that certain parties may attempt to access or recover that document through unauthorized means."

"What kind of unauthorized means?"

"The kind that resulted in a security breach in Sector Seven last evening."

Claire felt her pulse spike. "Someone broke into the Concordium vault?"

"Someone broke into the Concordium vault," Cardinal Torretti confirmed. "Someone with capabilities that suggest supernatural origin and resources that suggest significant political backing. We need to know who, and we need to know why."

"And you think I can help with that?"

"I think, Miss Mercier, that you may be the only person in this institution with the specialized knowledge necessary to understand the political implications of this theft attempt."

Claire looked at Cardinal Torretti—who clearly knew more about supernatural politics than he was admitting, was definitely involved in whatever had happened to the Concordium Scroll, and was quite possibly evaluating her as either an asset or a threat—and realized that her academic career had just taken a very sharp turn into genuinely dangerous territory.

"Your Eminence," she said carefully, "what exactly are you asking me to do?"

"I'm asking you to help us understand who would want to steal the Concordium Scroll, why they would risk exposure to obtain it, and what they might be planning to do with it once they have it."

"And if I agree to help?"

"Then you'll be granted access to materials and information that very few people in the world are permitted to see. You'll also be accepting responsibility for maintaining absolute discretion about everything you learn."

"And if I decline?"

Cardinal Torretti's smile suggested that declining wasn't really an option.

"Miss Mercier," he said quietly, "I don't think you understand the full scope of what's at stake here. The Concordium agreements aren't just historical curiosities. They're the foundation of a carefully maintained balance that prevents supernatural society from coming into direct conflict with human institutions. If those agreements fail, the consequences will extend far beyond academic interest."

Claire felt something cold settle in her chest. "What kind of consequences?"

"The kind that reshape civilization."

Behind the Cardinal, Claire caught a glimpse of movement near the storage closet. Julian was still hidden, but she could sense his tension even from across the room.

"Your Eminence," she said, "I'll need some time to consider your request."

"I'm afraid time is a luxury we don't have." Cardinal Torretti reached into his jacket and withdrew a thin folder. "This contains preliminary briefing materials about the current political situation. Review them today. We'll meet again tomorrow morning to discuss your decision."

He placed the folder on her desk, then paused at the door.

"Miss Mercier," he said, "I hope you understand that your expertise makes you uniquely valuable to the Church's efforts to resolve this situation peacefully. I also hope you understand that this same expertise could make you a target for parties who prefer less diplomatic solutions."

After he left, Claire sat in silence for several minutes before Julian emerged from the storage closet.

"Well," he said quietly, "that was illuminating."

"You heard all of that?"

"I heard all of that." Julian's expression was troubled. "Claire, Cardinal Torretti is not what he appears to be."

"What do you mean?"

"I mean that I've been involved in supernatural diplomacy for six centuries, and I've never heard of a Cardinal Alessandro Torretti. Which suggests that either he's using a false identity, or he represents a faction within the Church that doesn't officially exist."

Claire felt her academic curiosity warring with a growing sense that she'd stumbled into something significantly more dangerous than historical research.

"So what do we do now?"

Julian smiled, though it didn't reach his eyes.

"Now," he said, "we find out what's really in that folder, and we figure out who's been lying to whom about the Concordium Scroll."

As Claire reached for the folder Cardinal Torretti had left behind, she found herself thinking that her definition of "complicated research project" had undergone some significant revision in the past twenty-four hours.
