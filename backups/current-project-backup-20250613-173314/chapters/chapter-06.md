# Chapter 6: Flight from Sanctuary

*Afternoon, Rome*

---

Claire had always thought that the phrase "leap of faith" was metaphorical until she found herself thirty feet above St. Peter's Square, held against a six-hundred-year-old vampire's chest, discovering that her understanding of physics had been somewhat limited.

Julian landed on the cobblestones with the kind of fluid grace that suggested defying gravity was a perfectly normal Tuesday activity for him. Claire, on the other hand, was fairly certain she'd left her stomach somewhere around the second-story window.

"You can breathe now," Julian said quietly, though he didn't immediately release her from what she was trying very hard not to think of as an embrace.

"I'm processing," Claire managed. "Give me a moment to catalog the fact that I just escaped from the Vatican through a third-story window."

"We don't have a moment." Julian's attention was focused on the windows above them, where she could see figures moving with the kind of urgent efficiency that suggested pursuit was imminent. "Claire, we need to move. Now."

She looked around St. Peter's Square, taking in the hundreds of tourists who were completely oblivious to the supernatural drama that had just unfolded above their heads. "Where exactly are we supposed to go? Julian, this is Vatican City. There are maybe six ways out, and all of them involve passing through security checkpoints."

"Seven ways out," Julian corrected, "but you're right about the security. Which is why we're not taking any of them."

"What do you mean we're notâ€”"

Julian took her hand, and Claire found herself moving through the crowd with a speed that should have been impossible without attracting attention. Somehow, tourists seemed to step aside without quite realizing they were doing so, creating a clear path toward the edge of the square.

"How are you doing that?" she asked.

"Doing what?"

"Making people move without actually doing anything."

"Vampires are designed to avoid drawing unwanted attention," Julian said. "It's a survival mechanism."

Claire filed this information away for future consideration, along with the growing list of things about vampire physiology that weren't covered in historical documentation. "Where are we going?"

"The Passetto di Borgo."

Claire stopped walking so abruptly that Julian had to catch her arm to keep her upright. "The Passetto is sealed. It's been sealed for decades."

"The public entrance is sealed," Julian corrected. "There are other ways in."

"How do you know about other ways in?"

Julian's smile suggested that his knowledge of Vatican architecture extended well beyond what was available in tourist guidebooks. "I've been visiting Rome for six centuries, Claire. I've had time to explore."

They reached the edge of St. Peter's Square, where the ancient walls of Vatican City met the bustling streets of modern Rome. Julian led her toward what appeared to be a completely ordinary section of medieval stonework, then stopped and placed his hand against a particular stone that looked identical to every other stone in the wall.

The stone moved.

"Secret passage," Claire said. "Of course there's a secret passage."

"The Vatican has been managing sensitive situations for nearly two thousand years," Julian said, guiding her through an opening that hadn't existed moments before. "They've learned the value of alternative transportation methods."

The passage beyond was narrow, dark, and clearly hadn't been designed with modern safety standards in mind. Ancient stone steps led downward into what appeared to be a tunnel that predated most of Rome's recorded history.

"Julian," Claire said as they descended, "how did you know about this passage?"

"I helped design it."

"When?"

"1527. The Sack of Rome. The Pope needed reliable escape routes that didn't depend on the cooperation of potentially hostile forces."

Claire felt that familiar academic excitement override her growing anxiety about their situation. "You worked with Pope Clement VII?"

"I worked with several people who were trying to keep Pope Clement VII alive during a particularly complicated political crisis. The passage was one of several collaborative projects."

"Collaborative projects between the Church and vampire society."

"Collaborative projects between people who understood that certain problems require unconventional solutions."

They reached the bottom of the steps, where the passage opened into what appeared to be a section of the ancient Roman sewer system that had been modified for more discrete transportation purposes. Electric lighting had been installed at some point in the past century, though the overall atmosphere remained decidedly medieval.

"This connects to the Passetto di Borgo?" Claire asked.

"This connects to several things," Julian said. "Including routes that will take us well beyond Vatican security perimeters."

They moved through the tunnel system with Julian navigating by memory and Claire trying to reconcile her academic knowledge of Roman architecture with the reality of secret passages that didn't appear in any historical documentation she'd encountered.

"Julian," she said after they'd been walking for several minutes, "I need to understand something. How much of Rome's history has been deliberately hidden from public knowledge?"

"How much of any history has been deliberately hidden from public knowledge?" Julian countered. "Claire, you've spent eight years cataloging supernatural incidents that officially never happened. Did you think Rome was somehow exempt from that pattern?"

Claire considered this as they navigated what appeared to be a junction where their tunnel connected to three other passages. "The entire city is riddled with secret infrastructure."

"The entire city has been the center of supernatural politics for nearly two millennia. Secret infrastructure tends to accumulate."

"And you know all of it?"

"I know enough of it." Julian paused at the junction, listening to something Claire couldn't hear. "Though I suspect we're about to discover whether my knowledge is current enough to be useful."

"What do you mean?"

"I mean that we're being followed."

Claire felt her pulse spike. "How can you tell?"

"I can hear them. Three people, moving through the passage we just left, approximately two minutes behind us."

"Cardinal Torretti's people?"

"Cardinal Torretti's people, or someone else who has access to Vatican security protocols." Julian studied the three passage options in front of them. "Claire, I need to ask you something, and I need you to answer quickly. How well do you know Rome's underground geography?"

"I know the tourist areas. I know some of the archaeological sites. I know the general layout of the ancient sewer systems from an academic perspective."

"Do you know the connections between the ancient systems and the modern metro tunnels?"

Claire felt pieces clicking into place. "You want to use the subway system to get across the city."

"I want to use several transportation systems to get across the city in ways that will be difficult to track or predict."

"And you need my knowledge of the connections."

"I need your knowledge of the connections, and I need your understanding of how someone with Cardinal Torretti's resources would expect us to move."

Claire looked at the three passage options, trying to visualize the underground geography of Rome and calculate the most efficient routes to various parts of the city. "The middle passage should connect to the Castel Sant'Angelo area. From there, we can access the metro system near Lepanto station."

"And from Lepanto?"

"From Lepanto, we have access to most of the city. But Julian, if we use public transportation, we'll be visible. There will be security cameras, ticket records, potential witnesses."

"There will also be crowds, multiple exit options, and the ability to move faster than people following us on foot through tunnel systems."

The sound of footsteps in the passage behind them was growing closer.

"Decision time," Julian said.

Claire took one more look at the passage options, then pointed toward the middle tunnel. "Castel Sant'Angelo. But we move fast, and we don't use the same exit strategy twice."

"Agreed."

They entered the middle passage, moving with the kind of speed that Claire was beginning to realize was possible when one member of the partnership wasn't limited by normal human endurance. Julian seemed capable of maintaining a pace that was just short of running indefinitely, while Claire found herself grateful for eight years of walking through Vatican corridors had given her better cardiovascular fitness than the average academic.

"Julian," she said as they navigated what appeared to be a section of tunnel that connected to the Castel Sant'Angelo's underground chambers, "what exactly is our plan once we reach the metro system?"

"Short term: create enough confusion about our location and direction that pursuit becomes impractical."

"And long term?"

"Long term: find allies who can help us locate the actual Concordium Scroll and figure out what Cardinal Torretti is really planning to do with it."

"What kind of allies?"

Julian's expression suggested that he was considering options that weren't covered in standard diplomatic protocols. "The kind that exist outside official Church and bloodline hierarchies."

They reached what appeared to be another junction, this one connecting to passages that led in multiple directions. Claire could see stairs leading upward toward what was probably street level, and she could hear the distinctive sound of Rome traffic filtering down from above.

"We're near Castel Sant'Angelo," she said.

"We're near several things," Julian agreed. "Including people who may be able to provide assistance."

"What kind of people?"

"People who trade in information and services that aren't available through conventional channels."

Claire felt something cold settle in her stomach. "You're talking about the supernatural black market."

"I'm talking about people who understand that the official version of supernatural politics is only part of the story."

Before Claire could ask for clarification, the sound of footsteps in the passage behind them became significantly closer. Julian grabbed her hand, pulling her toward the stairs that led to street level.

"Time for the next phase," he said.

They emerged from what appeared to be a maintenance entrance in an alley behind Castel Sant'Angelo, blinking in the bright Roman afternoon. Claire could hear the normal sounds of city lifeâ€”traffic, voices, street musiciansâ€”and realized that despite everything that had happened, the world was continuing exactly as it had before.

"Metro station," Julian said, orienting himself quickly.

"Three blocks north," Claire confirmed. "But Julian, once we're in the metro system, we're committed to whatever plan you have for finding these allies."

"Are you having second thoughts about allying yourself with people who operate outside official channels?"

Claire looked back at the maintenance entrance they'd just exited, then at Julian, who was clearly operating according to contingency plans that had been developed over centuries of supernatural politics.

"I'm having thoughts about the fact that six hours ago, my biggest concern was proper citation format for fourteenth-century manuscripts," she said. "Now I'm apparently fleeing through Rome's underground tunnel system with a vampire to seek assistance from supernatural black market dealers."

"And how do you feel about that?"

Claire considered the question with the same analytical precision she brought to all significant life decisions. The rational part of her mind pointed out that she'd abandoned her career, committed what was probably treason against Vatican interests, and was now trusting her safety to someone whose capabilities and motivations she didn't fully understand.

The rest of her mind pointed out that in the past six hours, she'd had more genuinely interesting conversations and made more meaningful choices than in the previous eight years combined.

"I feel like my life just became significantly more complicated," she said.

"And?"

"And I feel like that's probably not entirely a bad thing."

Julian smiled, and this time Claire was prepared for the flash of fangs.

"In that case, Dr. Mercier," he said, "let me introduce you to the part of Rome that doesn't appear in guidebooks."

As they made their way toward the metro station, moving through crowds of tourists and locals who had no idea they were looking at two fugitives from supernatural politics, Claire found herself thinking that her definition of "academic research" had just taken another significant step toward "active participation in impossible things."
