# Chapter 7: The Antiquarian's Vault

*Evening, Rome - Trastevere District*

---

Claire had always assumed that supernatural black markets would be more obviously supernatural and less obviously markets, but the storefront Julian led her to looked like any other antique shop in Trastevere—if you ignored the fact that the door had just materialized in a wall that had been solid stone moments before.

"Is that normal?" she asked, staring at the wooden door with its brass nameplate reading "Collezioni Rare" in elegant script.

"Define normal," Julian said, though she could see him scanning the street with the kind of systematic attention that suggested he was evaluating potential threats. "The Antiquarian prefers to maintain a certain degree of... discretion about their location."

"The Antiquarian?"

"Think of them as a broker. They facilitate transactions between parties who might not otherwise be able to do business safely."

Claire looked at the door, which was definitely real and definitely hadn't existed thirty seconds earlier. "Transactions involving what kinds of parties?"

"All kinds."

Julian knocked on the door with a specific pattern—three short, two long, one short—that suggested this wasn't his first visit. The door opened immediately, though Claire couldn't see anyone on the other side.

"Julian St. Claire," a voice said from somewhere inside the shop. The accent was unplaceable, the tone amused, and the speaker invisible. "How delightfully unexpected. Do come in, both of you."

Julian stepped through the doorway, and Claire followed, trying to process the fact that she was entering a building that had appeared on command to meet with someone whose voice seemed to come from nowhere.

The interior of the shop was significantly larger than the exterior suggested, which Claire was beginning to recognize as a pattern in supernatural architecture. Shelves stretched up toward a ceiling that was lost in shadows, filled with objects that ranged from obviously ancient to completely unidentifiable. Books, artifacts, weapons, jewelry, and things that might have been art or might have been ritual implements were arranged with the kind of systematic organization that suggested deep knowledge of supernatural taxonomy.

"Dr. Mercier, I presume," the voice continued, and Claire caught a glimpse of movement among the shelves. "Your reputation precedes you, though your current circumstances are rather more dramatic than your academic profile would suggest."

"My reputation?" Claire asked, then decided she probably didn't want to know how her name had reached supernatural information networks.

"Eight years of meticulous documentation of supernatural incidents, with particular expertise in medieval Church-vampire relations." The speaker stepped into view from behind a shelf lined with what appeared to be ceremonial masks. "Your work has been quite valuable to those of us who prefer accurate historical context for our business dealings."

The Antiquarian was tall and elegant, with sharp cheekbones and silver-streaked dark hair that fell to their shoulders. Their age was impossible to determine—they could have been forty or four hundred—and their clothes seemed to shift between masculine and feminine cuts depending on the angle of observation. Most importantly, their eyes held the kind of ancient intelligence that suggested they'd seen enough of the world to find most things amusing rather than surprising.

"You've read my work?" Claire asked.

"I've acquired copies of your work. Academic documentation of supernatural politics is surprisingly difficult to obtain through legitimate channels." The Antiquarian moved toward what appeared to be a tea service that hadn't been there moments before. "Julian, you look tired. And injured. How interesting."

"Vesper," Julian said, and Claire caught the subtle shift in his tone that suggested a complicated history. "I need sanctuary. For both of us."

"Sanctuary implies pursuit. Pursuit implies conflict. Conflict implies profit opportunities." The Antiquarian—Vesper—poured tea into cups that seemed to be made from crystal that shifted color as the liquid touched it. "Tell me about your recent adventures."

Julian accepted a cup of tea and moved to one of the chairs that had arranged themselves around a low table. "The Concordium Scroll has been stolen."

"Has it?" Vesper's expression didn't change, but Claire caught something that might have been surprise or might have been calculation. "How unfortunate. By whom?"

"That's what we're trying to determine."

"And why come to me?"

"Because you have access to information networks that operate outside official channels. Because you've been tracking supernatural political movements for longer than most governments have existed. And because you owe me a favor from 1892."

Vesper laughed, a sound like silver bells that carried an undertone of something significantly less pleasant. "1892. The incident with the Romanian delegation. You're calling in that debt for this?"

"I'm calling in that debt for this."

Claire accepted a cup of tea and tried to follow the conversation while simultaneously cataloging the artifacts she could see around the shop. Most were unidentifiable, but she recognized what appeared to be illuminated manuscripts, ceremonial weapons, and objects that might have been religious relics from traditions she couldn't identify.

"Very well," Vesper said, settling into a chair that seemed to adjust its shape to accommodate their preferred sitting position. "Sanctuary granted. Now, tell me about the theft."

Julian outlined the events of the past day, from his break-in at the Vatican to their escape through Rome's underground passages. Claire found herself adding details about Cardinal Torretti's recruitment attempt and the documents he'd shown her.

"Fascinating," Vesper said when they'd finished. "And you believe Cardinal Torretti orchestrated the theft to justify unilateral modifications to the Concordium agreements?"

"It's the most logical explanation," Claire said. "The timing, the surveillance information, the fact that he knew exactly what had happened—it all suggests institutional involvement at the highest levels."

"There's one problem with that theory," Vesper said quietly. "The Concordium Scroll was never in the Vatican vault."

Claire felt something cold settle in her stomach. "What do you mean?"

"I mean that the document stolen from the Vatican three weeks ago was a copy. A very good copy, made with appropriate materials and aged with considerable skill, but a copy nonetheless."

Julian went very still. "How do you know?"

"Because I authenticated the original Concordium Scroll eighteen months ago for a client who wanted to verify its provenance before entering into certain negotiations."

"What client?" Julian's voice carried an edge that suggested he was calculating the implications of this information.

"A client who paid handsomely for discretion, which means I'm not at liberty to provide details." Vesper sipped their tea with the kind of deliberate casualness that suggested they were enjoying the dramatic tension. "However, I can tell you that the authentication process revealed some interesting features of the document."

"What kind of features?"

"Features that suggest the original scroll has been modified multiple times over the centuries, with additions and alterations that don't appear in any of the historical copies maintained by either the Church or the bloodlines."

Claire felt pieces clicking into place with the systematic precision that usually accompanied her best historical research. "Someone has been changing the terms of the agreement without informing either party."

"Someone has been changing the terms of the agreement with remarkable subtlety over the course of several decades," Vesper corrected. "The modifications are sophisticated enough that they would require access to the original document, extensive knowledge of medieval Latin, and skills in manuscript modification that are... rare."

"Who has those skills?" Julian asked.

"Very few people. Which is why the client who commissioned the authentication was so interested in determining exactly what changes had been made."

Claire leaned forward, her academic excitement overriding her concern about their situation. "What did the authentication reveal?"

Vesper smiled, and Claire caught a glimpse of teeth that were pointed in ways human teeth shouldn't be. "It revealed that the Concordium Scroll currently includes provisions that appear nowhere in the historical documentation maintained by either the Church or the bloodlines. Provisions that significantly alter the balance of power between the two communities."

"In whose favor?" Julian asked.

"That depends on how you interpret them. The language is sufficiently ambiguous that both sides could argue the modifications serve their interests."

"Which means both sides could argue the modifications justify breaking the agreement entirely," Claire said.

"Precisely."

Julian set down his teacup with the kind of controlled precision that suggested he was working to maintain his calm. "Vesper, who commissioned the authentication?"

"I told you, discretion was part of the arrangement."

"Vesper," Julian said quietly, "if someone has been modifying the Concordium Scroll for decades, and if those modifications are designed to create ambiguity about the terms of the agreement, then we're not looking at a simple theft. We're looking at a long-term strategy to destabilize supernatural-human relations."

"Yes," Vesper agreed. "Quite sophisticated, really. Whoever planned this has been thinking several moves ahead."

"And you have no idea who it might be?"

Vesper was quiet for a long moment, studying Julian with an expression that suggested they were weighing competing loyalties. "Julian," they said finally, "how much do you know about Amon's recent activities?"

Claire felt Julian go very still beside her. "What about Amon?"

"He's been making inquiries about the Concordium Scroll. Very specific inquiries about the document's authentication history and current location."

"When?"

"The inquiries began approximately six months ago. They've become increasingly urgent in recent weeks."

Julian's expression had grown increasingly troubled. "Vesper, if Amon is involved in this situation, then we're dealing with something significantly more dangerous than treaty modification."

"Who's Amon?" Claire asked.

Julian and Vesper exchanged glances that suggested they were both calculating how much information to share.

"Amon is..." Julian paused, clearly choosing his words carefully. "He's someone who believes that the current arrangement between human and supernatural communities is fundamentally flawed."

"He believes that vampires should rule openly," Vesper clarified. "He considers the Concordium agreements to be an unacceptable limitation on vampire society's natural superiority."

Claire felt pieces clicking into place with increasing alarm. "He wants to start a war."

"He wants to win a war," Julian corrected. "The question is whether he's working alone or whether he has allies within either the Church or the bloodlines."

"Or both," Vesper said quietly.

The tea service began to clear itself away with the kind of supernatural efficiency that Claire was beginning to recognize as normal in this environment. Around them, the shop seemed to be adjusting its layout, with shelves moving and artifacts rearranging themselves according to some logic she couldn't identify.

"Vesper," Julian said, "I need to know everything you can tell me about Amon's inquiries. Timing, specific questions, any associates or allies he might have mentioned."

"That information will cost you."

"What kind of cost?"

Vesper smiled with an expression that suggested they'd been waiting for this moment. "I want you to authenticate a document for me. One that requires your particular expertise in medieval supernatural politics."

"What document?"

"A contract. Very old, very complicated, involving parties who are no longer available for consultation."

Julian studied Vesper with an expression that suggested he was calculating the risks of accepting whatever deal was being offered. "What kind of contract?"

"The kind that could significantly alter the current balance of power in supernatural society, if its terms were properly understood and implemented."

Claire looked between Julian and Vesper, both of whom were clearly negotiating according to rules she didn't understand. "Are you talking about another treaty? Something that predates the Concordium Scroll?"

"I'm talking about something that could make the Concordium Scroll irrelevant," Vesper said. "If someone were interested in that kind of outcome."

The implications hit Claire with the force of a complete paradigm shift. "There's another document. Something that supersedes the Concordium agreements."

"There might be," Vesper said carefully. "If such a document existed, and if its authenticity could be verified, it would certainly complicate the current political situation."

Julian was quiet for a long moment, clearly weighing competing risks and benefits. "If I authenticate your document, you'll provide complete information about Amon's activities?"

"Complete information about Amon's activities, plus sanctuary for as long as you need it, plus access to my information networks for tracking the current location of the actual Concordium Scroll."

"And if the document I authenticate turns out to be something that could destabilize supernatural society?"

"Then you'll have the satisfaction of knowing exactly what's at stake before you decide how to respond to it."

Claire looked at Julian, who was clearly considering an agreement that could provide them with crucial information at the cost of potentially making their situation significantly more complicated.

"Julian," she said quietly, "what exactly are we getting ourselves into?"

Julian smiled, though it didn't reach his eyes. "I think, Dr. Mercier, that we're about to discover that the political situation is even more complex than we realized."

As Vesper led them deeper into the shop toward what appeared to be a vault filled with documents that probably shouldn't exist, Claire found herself thinking that her understanding of supernatural politics had just taken another significant step toward "genuinely terrifying."
