# Chapter 3: Reluctant Alliance

*Continuing immediately, late evening, Vatican City*

---

Claire had always prided herself on being practical in crisis situations, but she'd never actually planned for the scenario where she'd need to provide first aid to a centuries-old vampire in the basement of the Vatican.

Julian St. Claire was unconscious but still breathing, which she chose to interpret as a positive sign despite her complete lack of knowledge about vampire physiology. His pulse, when she could find it, was steady but slow, and his skin was cold enough to suggest hypothermia if he'd been human. Since he clearly wasn't human, she decided to file those observations under "potentially normal for his species" and focus on the more obvious problem.

He was bleeding. A lot.

"Father," she called over her shoulder, not taking her eyes off Julian's injuries, "I need the emergency medical kit from the office. And possibly some towels. And maybe a prayer or two, depending on your position on providing aid to supernatural entities."

"Claireâ€”"

"The medical kit, Father. We can have a theological debate about the ethics of vampire first aid after we've made sure he doesn't bleed to death in the Vatican's most secure archive."

She heard Father Calder's footsteps moving away with reluctant efficiency, and turned her attention back to Julian. His coat and shirt were torn in several places, revealing what looked like claw marks across his ribs and shoulder. The wounds were deep but clean, as if they'd been made by something very sharp and very angry.

"What attacked you?" she asked quietly, more to herself than to him.

To her surprise, Julian's eyes opened, focusing on her with effort that suggested consciousness was requiring significant willpower.

"Not attacked," he said, his voice barely above a whisper but still carrying that careful formality. "Warned."

"Warned? By whom?"

"Someone who wanted to ensure I understood the consequences of continuing my search." Julian shifted slightly, trying to sit up, and immediately went pale enough that Claire was genuinely concerned he might actually die.

"Stop moving," she said firmly, placing a hand on his chest to keep him flat. "You've lost enough blood to kill a normal person twice over. I don't know what the vampire equivalent of shock is, but I'm pretty sure you're experiencing it."

Something that might have been amusement flickered across his features. "You're remarkably calm for someone administering first aid to a creature that most people would consider a monster."

"Most people haven't spent eight years cataloging documented evidence of supernatural encounters," Claire pointed out. "Besides, you said 'please' when you introduced yourself and apologized for the breaking and entering. Historically speaking, monsters have worse manners."

"Historically speaking, you may have an overly optimistic view of my species' social graces."

Father Calder returned with the medical kit and an armful of towels, his expression carefully neutral in the way that suggested he was actively working to appear calm. "How is he?"

"Bleeding, conscious, and apparently capable of polite conversation despite significant trauma," Claire said, opening the medical kit and pulling out antiseptic and bandages. "Which raises some interesting questions about vampire physiology that I'm filing away for later consideration."

She began cleaning the wounds on Julian's shoulder, noting that they were already beginning to show signs of healing. Not human-fast healing, but definitely faster than normal.

"Accelerated tissue regeneration," she murmured, half to herself.

"One of the advantages of my condition," Julian agreed. "Though it requires a certain degree of... cooperation from my circulatory system."

"Meaning you need blood to heal properly."

"Meaning I need blood to heal at all." Julian's gaze shifted to Father Calder. "Which brings us to an interesting theological question, Father. The Church has been aware of my kind for centuries. Do your current humanitarian guidelines extend to providing medical assistance to vampires?"

Father Calder's expression suggested he was calculating several different kinds of consequences. "That would depend on the circumstances."

"The circumstances being that I came here seeking a document that was promised to be in Church custody, found an empty vault, and was subsequently attacked by parties unknown who wanted to discourage my continued investigation."

Claire paused in her bandaging. "You were attacked after you left the vault? By whom?"

"I'm not certain. They moved too quickly for clear identification, but they were definitely not human. And they seemed remarkably well-informed about my presence here."

"Someone was watching the vault," Father Calder said quietly.

"Someone was expecting me to come here," Julian corrected. "Which suggests that either the information I received about the scroll's location was deliberately false, or someone wanted to ensure I wouldn't find what I was looking for."

Claire felt that familiar tingle of academic excitement override her concern about treating wounded supernatural entities. "You're talking about a setup. Someone wanted you to break into the Vatican archives, find an empty vault, and then get attacked to discourage further investigation."

"That would be my assessment, yes."

"But why?" She finished bandaging his shoulder and moved to the wounds on his ribs, noting that these were deeper and showed signs of having been inflicted by something with significantly more force than normal claws. "If someone wanted to keep you away from the Concordium Scroll, why not just refuse to tell you where it was? Why orchestrate this elaborate misdirection?"

Julian was quiet for a long moment, his gaze fixed on the stone ceiling above them. "Because," he said finally, "they wanted me to know that the scroll has been moved. They wanted me to understand that the old agreements are no longer being honored."

"What old agreements?" Claire asked, though she suspected she already knew.

"The Concordium Scroll," Father Calder said, his voice carrying the weight of reluctant honesty, "documents the terms of a truce negotiated between the Church and the vampire bloodlines in the fourteenth century. The agreement has been... renewed several times over the centuries, most recently in 1987."

Claire sat back on her heels, processing this information with the same systematic approach she used for everything else that challenged her understanding of reality. "There's been an active diplomatic relationship between the Catholic Church and vampire society for six hundred years."

"Not diplomatic," Julian said. "Practical. The relationship exists because both sides understand that the alternative is significantly worse."

"What's the alternative?"

"War," Father Calder and Julian said simultaneously.

Claire looked between them, noting the way Father Calder's expression had shifted from reluctant concern to something that looked almost like fear. "What kind of war?"

"The kind that ends with either the exposure of supernatural society to the human world, or the complete subjugation of humanity to supernatural rule," Julian said. "Neither outcome is particularly appealing to anyone involved."

"So the truce maintains a balance of power."

"The truce maintains the illusion that there is a balance of power," Julian corrected. "In reality, it's a carefully negotiated set of compromises that allows both sides to coexist without destroying each other or exposing the supernatural world to human awareness."

Claire finished bandaging his ribs and sat back, studying both men with the analytical precision she usually reserved for particularly complex historical documents. "And now someone has stolen the document that codifies these agreements."

"Stolen, hidden, or destroyed," Julian agreed. "Any of which would constitute an act of aggression against both the Church and the bloodlines."

"But who would benefit from starting a supernatural war?"

The look Julian and Father Calder exchanged suggested they both had theories about that, but neither seemed inclined to share them.

"That," Julian said, "is what I came here to investigate."

Father Calder's expression had grown increasingly troubled throughout this conversation, and Claire could see him weighing competing loyalties with visible difficulty. "Julian," he said finally, "there are things about the current political situation that you need to understand."

"Such as?"

"The Concordium Scroll was moved from this vault three weeks ago. It was transferred to a different secure location for 'verification and updating.'"

Julian went very still. "Verification and updating by whom?"

"I'm not privy to those details."

"Father," Julian said, and Claire heard something dangerous creep into his voice despite his careful politeness, "if the Church is unilaterally modifying the terms of the Concordium agreement without consulting the bloodlines, that constitutes a violation of the truce."

"I understand the implications."

"Do you? Because the last time someone attempted to modify the Concordium terms without proper consultation, it took two years and approximately three hundred deaths to restore diplomatic relations."

Claire felt her pulse spike. "Three hundred deaths?"

"The supernatural community takes treaty violations very seriously," Julian said. "As does the Church, when it serves their interests."

Something in Father Calder's expression shifted, and Claire saw past his carefully maintained neutrality to something that looked remarkably like guilt.

"Father," she said quietly, "what aren't you telling us?"

For a moment, she thought he might actually answer honestly. Then his expression closed off completely, and Claire realized that whatever Father Calder knew about the current situation, he wasn't prepared to share it with either of them.

"I think," he said carefully, "that we should focus on getting Julian medical attention and then determining the safest way to resolve this situation without escalating tensions between the Church and the bloodlines."

"The safest way," Julian said, "would be to return the Concordium Scroll to its proper location and ensure that any modifications to the agreement are negotiated through appropriate diplomatic channels."

"And if the scroll has been moved for legitimate security reasons?"

"Then those reasons should be communicated to the bloodlines through established protocols."

"And if it hasn't?"

Julian's smile was sharp enough to remind Claire that despite his polite manner and current vulnerability, she was dealing with a predator who had survived for six centuries.

"Then someone is about to discover why the bloodlines have maintained their independence for so long."

Claire looked between them, noting the careful way they were avoiding direct confrontation while making their respective positions absolutely clear. "This is a diplomatic crisis," she said.

"This is a potential diplomatic crisis," Father Calder corrected. "If handled properly, it can be resolved without escalating to actual conflict."

"And if handled improperly?"

"Then we'll discover whether the modern world is prepared for the consequences of a supernatural war."

Claire felt something cold settle in her stomach. "How many people know about this? About the truce, about vampire society, about any of it?"

"Fewer than you might think," Julian said. "More than you'd hope."

"The Church maintains a small council of officials who are aware of supernatural realities," Father Calder explained. "The vampire bloodlines have their own governing structures. Most of both communities exist in ignorance of the larger political situation."

"Which means if this escalates to actual conflict, most of the people involved won't understand why they're fighting."

"Most wars begin that way," Julian said quietly.

Claire stood up, brushing dust off her knees and trying to process the fact that she'd just provided first aid to a vampire while learning that she was potentially witnessing the opening moves of a supernatural war that could reshape human society.

"Okay," she said. "What do we do now?"

Both men looked at her with expressions of surprise.

"We?" Julian asked.

"I'm the senior archivist for supernatural documentation," Claire said. "I've just learned that there's an active political relationship between the Church and vampire society that's been ongoing for six centuries, and that someone has potentially stolen the foundational document that governs that relationship. This is exactly the kind of incident that falls under my professional purview."

"Claire," Father Calder said gently, "this situation is significantly more dangerous than cataloging historical supernatural encounters."

"Father, I just bandaged a vampire's wounds while discussing diplomatic protocols with someone who's old enough to have personally negotiated treaties with medieval popes. I think my definition of 'dangerous' has undergone some significant revision in the last hour."

Julian studied her with an expression that suggested he was reassessing his initial assumptions about her capabilities and potential usefulness. "Miss Mercier," he said, "are you suggesting that you want to help investigate the theft of the Concordium Scroll?"

"I'm suggesting that as the person in this room with the most comprehensive knowledge of supernatural documentation and Vatican archive protocols, I'm probably your best chance of figuring out where the scroll was moved and why."

"And you're willing to risk involvement in supernatural politics to satisfy your academic curiosity?"

Claire considered this question with the same careful analysis she brought to all major decisions. The rational part of her mind pointed out that getting involved in what was essentially a diplomatic crisis between two species could have consequences ranging from termination of employment to actual death. The rest of her mind pointed out that she'd just had the first genuinely interesting conversation of her professional career, and she'd spent eight years reading about supernatural encounters without ever having the chance to actually participate in one.

"Mr. St. Claire," she said, "I've dedicated my career to studying things that most people believe don't exist. The opportunity to actually help resolve a supernatural diplomatic crisis is not something I'm prepared to pass up."

Julian smiled, and this time Claire was prepared for the flash of fangs.

"In that case, Miss Mercier," he said, "I believe we have an alliance."

Behind them, Father Calder sighed deeply.

"Claire," he said, "I really hope you understand what you're getting yourself into."

As she looked down at Julian St. Claireâ€”wounded vampire, potential diplomatic envoy, and quite possibly the most dangerous person she'd ever metâ€”Claire found herself thinking that understanding had always been overrated anyway.
