# Chapter 10: The Living Names

Nine names remained uncrossed on Harold's list, and Jack was beginning to understand that each one represented someone whose survival depended on protective protocols that had died with his father.

Eleanor Shaw had provided contact information for Harold's network—secure communication methods, verification protocols, and emergency procedures that felt like intelligence operations manual rather than family address book. Nine people whose technical expertise made them permanent targets for administrative elimination, now operating without defensive coverage that had kept them alive for decades.

Jack spread the information across his kitchen table like a safety inspection checklist. Different ages, different locations, different specialties, but all connected by classified knowledge that organizations preferred to control rather than risk exposure. Former communications specialists, civilian contractors, family members who'd gained access to sensitive information through marriages or employment that had ended decades ago.

Nine people who didn't know that Harold Ellison's death had eliminated their protective status.

Jack began with systematic assessment of each individual's vulnerability profile. Location isolation, communication accessibility, family support networks, health status that might affect mobility or defensive capabilities. The kind of risk analysis he used for port facility safety evaluation, now applied to human targets requiring emergency protection.

Dr. Sarah Chen, Berkeley, California. Age 62, former signals analyst, currently teaching computer science at UC Berkeley. Recent widow, adult children living on East Coast, residential address available through public records. High visibility academic position providing some protection through institutional presence, but also creating predictable daily patterns that simplified surveillance targeting.

Professional assessment: Moderate vulnerability, high contact probability.

Frank Morrison, Tucson, Arizona. Age 71, former electronics technician, retired to desert cabin outside city limits. No family contact in recent years, minimal digital footprint, location providing operational isolation that enhanced defensive capabilities but eliminated emergency support options.

Professional assessment: High vulnerability, uncertain contact probability.

Elena Vasquez, San Antonio, Texas. Listed as "current status unknown" in Harold's files, with notation indicating "administrative review pending as of March 2024." Cross-referenced with Arthur Drell's documentation suggesting status change had been implemented but not confirmed through network verification.

Professional assessment: Possibly eliminated, investigation required.

Jack continued through the list, evaluating each person's operational profile through safety inspection methodology adapted for human protection requirements. Technical background assessment, threat environment analysis, communication capabilities, emergency response options. The systematic approach Harold had used for three decades to maintain protective networks that kept people alive rather than letting administrative efficiency eliminate them.

But systematic assessment revealed operational reality that made Jack's professional instincts activate emergency protocols. Nine people scattered across multiple states, operating without protective coverage, facing elimination pressure that could be implemented with administrative efficiency that left no obvious evidence of targeted assassination.

Jack needed to establish contact quickly, provide warning about changed protective status, and coordinate defensive measures before Dray's organization implemented systematic cleanup of Harold's entire network.

The first call required operational security protocols Maya had researched through academic databases that provided secure communication methods for sensitive conversations. Dr. Sarah Chen's university phone system included encryption capabilities designed for research coordination that could accommodate enhanced privacy requirements.

"Dr. Chen? This is Jack Ellison, Harold Ellison's son. I need to discuss your connection to my father's navy communications work."

Silence on the line. Not technical delay—the processing pause that meant Chen was evaluating whether Jack's contact represented legitimate family communication or operational compromise that required immediate security measures.

"Harold passed away two weeks ago," Jack continued. "Before his death, he left information indicating that people connected to his work might be facing security risks requiring protective attention."

"Mr. Ellison." Chen's voice carried the particular control of someone who'd been expecting contact related to security concerns she'd hoped to avoid. "This conversation would be better conducted through secure channels. Are you familiar with operational communication requirements for sensitive discussions?"

Jack recognized the language pattern—Chen was assessing his security clearance and training while avoiding acknowledgment of classified activities over unsecured communication systems.

"I'm learning through necessity. My father left documentation about protective protocols he'd maintained for people whose technical knowledge posed ongoing security concerns. That documentation suggests protective coverage has been disrupted."

"I understand." Chen's response carried weight that suggested she'd been conducting her own threat assessment and recognized that Harold's death created operational vulnerabilities for his entire network. "Can you travel to California? There are discussions that require appropriate security measures."

Chen provided meeting coordinates and timing specifications that indicated professional training in defensive communication protocols. Academic setting that provided operational cover while offering multiple escape routes and institutional security presence that would complicate assassination attempts.

The second call required different operational approach. Frank Morrison's desert isolation meant communication through amateur radio frequencies that Harold had documented as secure channels for emergency network coordination. Maya had identified appropriate equipment and helped Jack establish contact protocols that avoided normal communication systems.

Morrison's response confirmed Jack's threat assessment. "Been expecting someone to contact me about Harold's situation. Desert provides good defensive positioning, but haven't had communication from protective network for three weeks. Starting to implement emergency protocols Harold taught me in case administrative coverage was disrupted."

Professional language that indicated Morrison understood operational reality and had been preparing for elimination attempts that might follow Harold's death. Self-defense measures rather than protective network coordination, but sufficient to maintain survival until alternative defensive arrangements could be established.

Jack attempted contact with Elena Vasquez through multiple communication methods, but response patterns suggested that Drell's documentation had been accurate. Phone numbers disconnected, email addresses inactive, residential address showing no recent activity according to public utility records Maya accessed through academic research systems.

Elena Vasquez had apparently been eliminated with administrative efficiency that left minimal evidence of targeted assassination.

Professional assessment: Eliminated, investigate timeline and methodology for defensive intelligence.

Jack completed network assessment and coordinated with Eleanor Shaw through secure communication protocols she'd established for emergency network coordination. Nine names on Harold's list, six successfully contacted, one eliminated, two requiring further investigation. Network survival rate indicating that systematic elimination was proceeding with administrative efficiency designed to appear consistent with natural mortality patterns.

Eleanor's response confirmed operational reality Jack had begun to understand through his assessment procedures.

"Harold's network required constant maintenance to keep people alive. His death disrupted protective protocols that shielded vulnerable individuals from elimination pressures they often didn't recognize as targeted threats. Administrative cleanup is proceeding systematically, but slowly enough to maintain operational cover through natural mortality appearance."

"How much time do we have?"

"Unknown. But elimination procedures are designed for efficiency rather than speed. Organizations implementing cleanup prefer administrative methods that avoid attention rather than obvious assassination that creates investigation problems."

Jack understood the operational timeline. Systematic elimination disguised as routine mortality, implemented with bureaucratic efficiency that made murder appear administrative rather than criminal. People dying from brief illnesses, sudden complications, engineered accidents that attracted no investigative attention from authorities trained to recognize obvious assassination rather than sophisticated elimination procedures.

Dr. Chen agreed to meet in Berkeley, providing access to evidence she'd maintained about Operation Quietus and contemporary continuation through private contractor management. Documentation that could explain elimination procedures and identify organizational capabilities that posed ongoing threats to network survivors.

Frank Morrison coordinated defensive positioning in Arizona desert location that provided operational security for emergency planning session. Desert isolation that eliminated surveillance opportunities while providing communication capabilities for network coordination that served protective rather than elimination functions.

Jack prepared for travel to California, understanding that meeting Chen would provide intelligence about elimination procedures while confirming his commitment to continuing Harold's protective operations rather than abandoning network survivors to administrative convenience.

Maya coordinated family communication protocols for circumstances requiring extended operational absence. Security measures that maintained family protective cover while allowing Jack to implement emergency network coordination that Harold's death had made necessary.

Some responsibilities required operational travel that put families at risk while serving protective functions for other people who depended on networks most citizens never knew existed.

Jack's investigation had revealed that Harold's list wasn't historical documentation—it was emergency contact roster for people whose survival required ongoing protective maintenance that had been disrupted by administrative elimination of network coordinator.

Nine people whose technical knowledge made them permanent targets for organizations that preferred cleanup to ongoing asset management.

Six people still requiring protective protocols that Jack was inheriting along with operational responsibilities Harold had maintained for thirty-seven years.

One person eliminated with administrative efficiency that demonstrated organizational capabilities Jack would need to understand if he wanted to prevent additional network losses.

The countdown that had started with Harold's death was continuing with systematic precision.

But now Jack understood that stopping it required operational commitment to protective work that would put his family at permanent risk while serving network defense functions that kept other people's families alive.

Harold had made that choice three decades ago.

Now Jack was beginning to understand what continuing his father's work would require in terms of operational sacrifice and family security compromise.

But incomplete circuits created dangerous feedback loops.

And this circuit required protective closure that only network maintenance could provide.

Jack secured his research and prepared for operational travel that would determine whether Harold Ellison's defensive network could be restored before administrative cleanup eliminated the remaining survivors.

Because some systems were worth maintaining even when they required personal sacrifice that made normal family life impossible.

And Jack was beginning to understand that technical expertise meant nothing if it wasn't used to protect people from institutional dangers they couldn't defend against alone.
