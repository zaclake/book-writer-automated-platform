## 🚀 **COMMAND IMPLEMENTATIONS**

### **1. Clear Current Project**

#### Command: `"Clear current project"`

**Purpose:** Completely wipe the current project while staying in the same directory

**Process:**
1. **Confirmation prompt:** "⚠️ This will delete all chapters, references, and project data. Type 'CONFIRM CLEAR' to proceed:"
2. **Backup creation:** Automatically create timestamped backup before clearing
3. **File cleanup:** Remove all project files except book-bible.md
4. **State reset:** Clear all tracking databases and metadata
5. **Fresh initialization:** Ready for new "Initialize my book project" command

**What gets cleared:**
- ✅ All chapters in `/chapters/` directory
- ✅ All reference files in `/references/` directory  
- ✅ All state tracking in `.project-state/`
- ✅ Project metadata in `.project-meta.json`
- ❌ **Preserves:** `book-bible.md` (so you can reinitialize)
- ❌ **Preserves:** `.notes/` directory (optional user content)

**Example Output:**
```
Project cleared successfully.
Backup saved to: ./backups/data-detective-backup-2024-01-20-14-45-00/
Ready for fresh initialization.
Next step: "Initialize my book project"
```

---

### **2. Start New Project**

#### Command: `"Start new project"` or `"Start new project 'ProjectName'"`

**Purpose:** Create a completely fresh project setup

**Two Approaches:**

#### **Approach A: Same Directory (Simple)**
```
"Start new project"
```
1. **Clear current directory** (with confirmation)
2. **Create fresh project structure**
3. **Initialize empty book-bible.md template**
4. **Set up metadata for new project**
5. **Guide user to next steps**

#### **Approach B: New Project Directory (Recommended)**
```
"Start new project 'Sci-Fi Novel'"
```
1. **Create new subdirectory:** `./sci-fi-novel/`
2. **Set up complete project structure** inside new directory
3. **Copy book-bible template** to new location
4. **Initialize project metadata** with provided name
5. **Switch working directory** to new project
6. **Register project** in master registry

**Example Output (Approach B):**
```
Creating new project: 'Sci-Fi Novel'
├── Directory created: ./sci-fi-novel/
├── Book bible template ready: ./sci-fi-novel/book-bible.md
├── Project structure initialized
├── Project registered in workspace
└── Switched to new project directory

Next steps:
1. Fill out ./sci-fi-novel/book-bible.md with your story
2. Run "Initialize my book project" to set up references
3. Start writing with "Write chapter 1"

Current project: Sci-Fi Novel
Location: ./sci-fi-novel/
```

### **Backup and Recovery System**

#### Automatic Backups
- **Before any destructive operation:** Clear, archive, major edits
- **Daily backup:** If project was actively worked on
- **Chapter completion backup:** After each successful chapter
- **Manual backup:** `"Backup current project"` command

#### Backup Structure
```
./backups/
├── data-detective-thriller-2024-01-25-14-30-00/
│   ├── backup-metadata.json
│   ├── book-bible.md
│   ├── .project-meta.json
│   ├── .project-state/ (complete copy)
│   ├── chapters/ (all chapters)
│   ├── references/ (all references)
│   └── notes/
```

---

## 🔧 **ERROR HANDLING & RECOVERY**

### **Common Scenarios**

#### **Project Corruption Detection:**
```
⚠️ Project integrity issue detected:
├── Missing reference files: 3 of 5
├── Chapter gaps: Missing chapter 4 and 6  
├── Broken pattern database: 247 entries corrupted
└── Quality baseline drift: Scores dropped below threshold

🔧 Recovery options:
1. "Restore from backup" - Roll back to last known good state
2. "Reinitialize references" - Regenerate missing reference files
3. "Repair project database" - Fix pattern and quality tracking
4. "Manual recovery mode" - Step-by-step guided repair

Recommended: Option 1 (Restore from backup)
Most recent backup: January 24, 2024 (1 day ago)
```

#### **Project Name Conflicts:**
```
⚠️ Project name conflict: "Fantasy Novel" already exists

Existing project:
├── Location: ./fantasy-novel/
├── Status: Paused (Chapter 5/20)
├── Last modified: 2 weeks ago
└── Word count: 12,456

Options:
1. "Load existing project" - Switch to existing Fantasy Novel
2. "Create 'Fantasy Novel 2'" - Create with modified name
3. "Replace existing project" - Archive old, create new (⚠️ destructive)
4. "Choose different name" - Start over with new name

What would you like to do?
```

### **Graceful Degradation**
- **Missing metadata:** Reconstruct from available files
- **Corrupted state:** Fall back to file-based tracking
- **Directory issues:** Offer to relocate or repair
- **Registry corruption:** Rebuild from project directories

---

## 📚 **UPDATED WORKFLOW EXAMPLES**

### **Starting Your First Project**
```
1. "Start new project 'Mystery Novel'"
   → Creates ./mystery-novel/ directory
   → Sets up book-bible.md template

2. Fill out book-bible.md with your story details

3. "Initialize my book project"  
   → Generates all reference files
   → Sets up project tracking

4. "Write chapter 1"
   → Uses project context for consistent writing
```

### **Managing Multiple Projects**
```
Current: Working on Mystery Novel (Chapter 5)

1. "Start new project 'Sci-Fi Thriller'"
   → Creates new project directory
   → Switches to new project

2. Fill out sci-fi book bible, initialize, write chapters 1-3

3. "Switch to project 'Mystery Novel'"
   → Returns to mystery project
   → Loads previous context and state

4. "Write chapter 6"
   → Continues where you left off
   → Maintains story consistency
```

### **Completing and Archiving**
```
1. "Write chapter 25" (final chapter)
   → Normal chapter generation

2. "Project status"
   → Shows completion indicators
   → Suggests archiving

3. "Archive current project"
   → Runs final quality audit
   → Creates completion report
   → Moves to archive directory
   → Clears workspace for next project
```

---

## ✅ **SUCCESS INDICATORS**

### **System Working Correctly When:**
- ✅ **Seamless project switching** without context loss
- ✅ **Perfect isolation** between different book projects  
- ✅ **Quality consistency** maintained per project
- ✅ **Pattern tracking** separate for each story

- ✅ **Reliable backup/restore** for any project state
- ✅ **Clean completion workflow** with archiving

### **User Experience Goals:**
- **Intuitive commands** that feel natural
- **Clear status feedback** for all operations  
- **No cross-project contamination** of characters/patterns
- **Effortless multi-book management** 
- **Safe experimentation** with backup protection
- **Professional project organization**

---

## 🎯 **INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING COMMANDS**

### **All Current Commands Enhanced But Unchanged:**

✅ **"Initialize my book project"** - Now project-aware, handles existing projects  
✅ **"Write chapter X"** - Uses current project context automatically  
✅ **"Rewrite chapter X"** - Maintains project-specific quality baselines  
✅ **Quality control commands** - Work within current project scope  
✅ **"Restore to chapter X"** - Project-aware rollback functionality  

### **New Commands Added:**

🆕 **"Clear current project"** - Clean slate in current directory  
🆕 **"Start new project"** - Complete project setup workflow  
🆕 **"Project status"** - Comprehensive project information  
🆕 **"Archive current project"** - Professional completion workflow  
🆕 **"List my projects"** - Multi-project overview and management  
🆕 **"Switch to project 'Name'"** - Context switching between projects  
🆕 **"Backup current project"** - Manual state preservation  

### **System Maintains Full Backward Compatibility:**
- Existing users see no change in their current workflow
- All existing projects continue working without modification  
- Current file structures preserved and enhanced
- Quality systems work exactly as before, now per-project
- Zero breaking changes to established commands
