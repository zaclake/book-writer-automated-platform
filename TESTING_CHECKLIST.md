## Debugging Commands üîß

If issues are found, use these console commands for debugging:

```javascript
// Check Firebase config
console.log('Firebase Config:', {
  apiKey: !!firebase.app().options.apiKey,
  projectId: firebase.app().options.projectId,
  // ... other config
})

// Test Firestore connection
import { ensureFirebaseInitialized } from '@/lib/firestore-client'
ensureFirebaseInitialized().then(ready => console.log('Firebase ready:', ready))

// Check authentication state
import { useAuth } from '@clerk/nextjs'
const { isSignedIn, userId, getToken } = useAuth()
getToken().then(token => console.log('Auth token:', !!token))
```

## Rollback Plan üîÑ

If any critical issues are found:

1. **Frontend rollback**: Previous deployment in Vercel
2. **Backend rollback**: Previous deployment in Railway  
3. **Database**: Firestore data is persistent (no rollback needed)
4. **Emergency fix**: Can quickly disable problematic features via environment variables
